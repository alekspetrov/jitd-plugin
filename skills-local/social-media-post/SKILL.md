2. **Apply Platform Rules**: Character limits, formatting, hashtag strategies
3. **Optimize for Algorithm**: Engagement tactics, timing recommendations
4. **Generate Variants**: Multiple options (short, medium, detailed)

## Platform Specifications

### Threads (Instagram)

**Character Limits**:
- Standard post: 500 characters
- Long-form (with attachment): 10,000 characters
- Display: Shows "Read more" after ~500 chars

**Formatting**:
‚úÖ Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
‚úÖ Emojis (count toward limit)
‚úÖ Bullet points (using ‚Ä¢ or -)
‚úÖ Line breaks
‚ùå No hashtags in Threads (algorithm ignores them)
‚ùå No clickable links in body (use link preview)

**Media**:
- Images: Up to 10 per post
- Video: Up to 5 minutes
- Link previews: Automatic from URLs

**Algorithm Priorities** (2025):
1. **Engagement** (40%): Likes, comments, shares, reply views
2. **Recency** (30%): Fresh content gets priority
3. **Interest/Relevance** (20%): Based on user's past interactions
4. **Profile Visits** (10%): Likelihood user will click profile

**Best Practices**:
‚úÖ Conversational, authentic tone (not corporate)
‚úÖ Ask open-ended questions
‚úÖ Create discussions, not announcements
‚úÖ Post consistently (1-3x daily)
‚úÖ Use visuals (images/videos boost engagement)
‚úÖ Respond to comments within 1 hour
‚ùå No direct cross-posts from Instagram/X
‚ùå Avoid promotional language
‚ùå No hashtags (they don't work on Threads)

**Optimal Posting Times** (US audience):
- Monday-Friday: 9-11 AM, 1-3 PM, 7-9 PM ET
- Saturday-Sunday: 10 AM-2 PM ET

**Content That Works**:
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Quick tips and tricks
- Relatable experiences
- Open-ended questions
- Industry discussions
- Memes (if relevant)

---

### X (Twitter)

**Character Limits**:
- Standard tweet: 280 characters
- Premium (Blue): 25,000 characters (displays with "Show more")

**Formatting**:
‚úÖ Emojis
‚úÖ Line breaks (use intentionally)
‚úÖ Mentions (@username)
‚úÖ Hashtags (max 2-3 per tweet)
‚ùå No rich text formatting

**Media**:
- Images: Up to 4 per tweet
- Video: Up to 2:20 (standard), 10 min (Blue)
- GIFs: 1 per tweet

**Algorithm Priorities** (2025):
1. **Engagement rate** (likes, retweets, replies)
2. **Recency** (fresh tweets prioritized)
3. **Media** (tweets with images/video perform better)
4. **Authenticity** (verified accounts, genuine engagement)

**Best Practices**:
‚úÖ Front-load important info (first 100 chars)
‚úÖ Use line breaks for readability
‚úÖ 1-2 hashtags max (more hurts engagement)
‚úÖ Include visual (image/video)
‚úÖ Tag relevant accounts (when appropriate)
‚úÖ Tweet threads for detailed content
‚ùå Don't overuse hashtags (looks spammy)
‚ùå Avoid link-only tweets (add context)

---

### Step 4: Add Metadata

For each variant, include:

```markdown

## Best Practices by Platform

### Threads
1. **Be conversational**: Avoid corporate speak
2. **Ask questions**: Drive engagement with open-ended questions
3. **No hashtags**: They don't work on Threads
4. **Respond fast**: Reply to comments within 1 hour
5. **Post consistently**: 1-3x daily for best reach
6. **Use visuals**: Images/videos boost engagement significantly
7. **Tell stories**: Personal experiences > announcements

### X (Twitter)
1. **Front-load value**: First 100 chars matter most
2. **Use threads**: Break complex topics into digestible tweets
3. **Limit hashtags**: 1-2 max, more hurts engagement
4. **Add media**: Tweets with images get 150% more engagement
5. **Be concise**: Shorter tweets (200-250 chars) perform better
6. **Time it right**: Post during work hours for tech audience

### LinkedIn
1. **Hook early**: First 2 lines show in feed, make them count
2. **Be professional**: But still authentic and relatable
3. **Use data**: Statistics and metrics boost credibility
4. **Tell stories**: Case studies and experiences resonate
5. **Engage back**: Comment on posts in your niche
6. **Post less, quality more**: 2-5x per week is optimal
