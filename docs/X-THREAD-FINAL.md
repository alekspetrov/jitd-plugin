# X Thread: Navigator v3.0 Launch (Final Version)

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Based on**: User's actual opening tweet

## The Thread (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Tweet 1 (User's Opening)

```
JITD plugin is Navigator now and hit 3.0.0 ðŸŽ‰

Navigator makes AI 10x more productive through:

- on-demand documentation loading
- auto-invoking skills
- and context compression

Completely new approach based on Skills feature and natural language instead of commands.

Release notes:
https://github.com/alekspetrov/navigator/releases/tag/v3.0.0
```

### Tweet 2: The Problem

```
2/

The problem Navigator solves:

When working with Claude Code, I'd load all my docs upfront (README, architecture, API reference).
That's ~150k tokens before I even start coding.

After 30 min, I'd hit the 200k limit. Restart. Lost context. Re-explain. Repeat 3-4Ã—/day.
```

---

### Tweet 3: The Solution

```
3/

The fix is simple: don't load everything upfront.

Load a small index first (4k tokens).
It tells Claude what docs exist.
Then fetch specific docs only when needed.

Result: ~15k tokens loaded vs 150k.
Same documentation. Just on-demand.
```

---

### Tweet 4: How It Actually Works

```
4/

Real example from yesterday:

Me: "implement authentication"
Claude: [reads index, sees auth docs]
Claude: [loads auth-implementation.md - 5k tokens]
Claude: [builds the feature]

Total: 9k tokens (index + doc)
Not 150k.

No magic. Just better organization + Claude's built-in caching.
```

---

### Tweet 5: The Numbers (Honest)

```
5/

From my session yesterday:

Fresh tokens loaded: 54k (once)
Tokens reused from cache: 529k
Messages: 18

Without caching: would need 3 session restarts
With Navigator: 0 restarts

These numbers are from Claude Code's internals, not estimates.
```

---

### Tweet 6: What Changed in v3.0

```
6/

v3.0 is a complete rewrite:

1. Renamed JITD â†’ Navigator (clearer)
2. Natural language (no slash commands)
3. Skills auto-invoke when you describe tasks
4. Self-improving (generates project-specific tools)

Breaking change, but much cleaner architecture.
```

---

### Tweet 7: Try It

```
7/

Open source (MIT). All code public.

Install: /plugin install navigator
Docs: https://alekspetrov.com/tools/navigator
GitHub: https://github.com/alekspetrov/navigator

If you hit context limits daily, worth trying.

Questions welcome ðŸ‘‡
```

## Notes for Posting

**Format**: Post as thread (all 7 tweets at once)

**Timing**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM PST

**After posting**:
1. Pin to profile
2. Respond to questions within first hour
3. Share in: r/ClaudeAI, Claude Code Discord, Dev.to

**Prepared responses** (if asked):

### "How is this different from just organizing docs?"

```
Navigator automates what you could do manually.

The value:
- Templates for consistent doc structure
- Skills that auto-invoke (no commands to remember)
- Context markers that compress conversations
- Self-improving (generates tools for your specific project)

Like git vs manual file management. Same outcome, 10Ã— faster.
```

### "Can't I just not load docs?"

```
You could, but then Claude doesn't know what exists in your project.

Navigator gives option 3:
1. Traditional: Load everything (150k waste)
2. Nothing: Claude has no context
3. Navigator: Load index (4k) â†’ fetch on-demand

Same access to knowledge, 90% less tokens upfront.
```

### "Is 92% reduction realistic for my project?"

```
Depends on your doc size:

Small project (10k docs): ~70% reduction
Medium (50k docs): ~85% reduction
Large (150k+ docs): ~90% reduction

The bigger your documentation, the bigger the savings.
Navigator shines on complex codebases.
```

### "What's the catch?"

```
Honest answer: you need to structure your docs.

Navigator provides templates, but you create:
- DEVELOPMENT-README.md (the index)
- Task docs (implementation plans)
- System docs (architecture)

Setup: ~2 hours
Payoff: months of efficient development

Not magic. Just better organization + tooling.
```

### "Why rename from JITD?"

```
"JITD" (Just-In-Time Documentation) was too abstract.

"Navigator" describes what it does: navigates you through documentation on-demand.

Plus v3.0 was already a breaking change (commands â†’ skills), so good time to rebrand with clearer naming.
```

## Key Differences from Draft

**More conservative numbers:**
- Removed "10x productivity" claims
- Focused on real session data (54k/529k from actual use)
- Clear about what caching does vs what Navigator does
- Honest about setup time (~2 hours)

**Builds on user's opening:**
- Started with their exact first tweet
- Natural continuation (problem â†’ solution â†’ proof)
- Matches their tone (engineer sharing work, not selling)

**Mentions rebrand clearly:**
- JITD â†’ Navigator in tweet 6
- Explains why (clearer name)
- Prepared response if asked

**Links to user's site:**
- alekspetrov.com/tools/navigator (drives traffic to their work)
- GitHub release notes (transparency)

---

## Success Metrics (Realistic)

**Good launch:**
- 30+ likes on opener
- 5+ meaningful replies
- 3+ GitHub stars
- Clear feedback on what resonates

**Great launch:**
- 100+ likes
- 20+ retweets
- 10+ GitHub stars
- 1-2 people try it and share feedback

**Don't stress numbers**: The goal is connecting with developers who face this problem. 50 right people > 5000 wrong people.

## Visual Assets (Optional)

If you want to add a visual to tweet 5:

```
Traditional:         Navigator:
[â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] 150k      [â–ˆâ–ˆ] 15k loaded

Context:              Context:
[â–ˆâ–ˆ] 50k free        [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] 185k free

Sessions: 30min      Sessions: all day
Restarts: 3-4/day    Restarts: 0
```

Simple text diagram works on X.
