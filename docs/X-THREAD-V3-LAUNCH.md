## The Thread

### Tweet 1: Hook
```
I just shipped Navigator v3.0 - a Claude Code plugin that solves context waste.

Here's how it actually works (with real numbers, not marketing):

ðŸ§µ
```

---

### Tweet 2: The Problem (Validated)
```
When you work with Claude Code, you have a 200k token limit.

Most developers load all their docs upfront:
- README: 20k tokens
- Architecture docs: 40k
- API reference: 50k
- Examples: 40k

That's 150k tokens consumed before you even start coding.
```

---

### Tweet 3: The Real Bottleneck
```
With only 50k tokens left (25% of your context), you hit limits fast.

After 30 minutes of work:
- Chat history: 40k
- Available: 10k
- Result: Session restart needed

You lose context. Re-explain everything. Repeat 3-4 times per day.
```

---

### Tweet 4: How Navigator Works (Part 1: Progressive Disclosure)
```
Navigator flips this approach.

Instead of loading everything upfront, it loads a small "navigator" first - just 4k tokens.

This navigator is like a table of contents. It tells Claude:
"Here's what docs exist. Load them ONLY when needed."
```

---

### Tweet 5: How Navigator Works (Part 2: On-Demand Loading)
```
Example workflow:

You: "I need to implement authentication"
Claude: [Reads navigator, sees auth docs exist]
Claude: [Loads auth-implementation.md - 5k tokens]
Claude: [Implements feature]

Only 9k tokens used (navigator + auth doc).
Not 150k.
```

---

### Tweet 6: How Navigator Works (Part 3: Skills Architecture)
```
v3.0 adds "skills" - pre-built tools that auto-invoke.

13 skills loaded, but here's the trick:
- Skill descriptions: 13 Ã— ~50 bytes = 650 tokens (always loaded)
- Skill instructions: 13 Ã— ~1.8k = 23.5k tokens (loaded ONLY when skill invokes)

Progressive disclosure: 650 tokens upfront, not 24k.
```

---

### Tweet 7: The Math (Transparent)
```
Traditional approach:
- All docs loaded: 150k tokens
- Available for work: 50k (25%)
- Session before restart: ~30 min

Navigator approach:
- Navigator: 4k
- Skill descriptions: 0.65k
- Loaded when needed: 5-10k per task
- Total: ~15k used
- Available: 185k (92%)
- Session length: All day
```

---

### Tweet 8: Real Session Data (My Actual Stats)
```
From this morning's session:

Messages: 18
Fresh tokens loaded: 54k (once)
Tokens reused from cache: 529k (10Ã— reuse)
Cache efficiency: 100%

Without caching, that would've been 583k tokens = 3 session restarts.
With Navigator: 0 restarts.
```

---

### Tweet 9: Why The Numbers Are Real
```
Claude Code caches documentation automatically.

Navigator optimizes for this:
1. Load navigator once (4k) â†’ cached
2. Load task doc when needed (5k) â†’ cached
3. Reuse both forever (0 additional tokens)

Each access after the first = free.

The 92% reduction isn't magic. It's caching + lazy loading.
```

---

### Tweet 10: Use Case 1 - Daily Development
```
Example: Building a login feature

Traditional:
- Load all docs (150k)
- Read 10 component examples (50k)
- Implement login
- Total: 200k+ â†’ restart needed

Navigator:
- Load navigator (4k cached)
- Say "add login component" â†’ frontend-component skill (1.8k)
- Generates component + tests following YOUR patterns
- Total: 6k
```

---

### Tweet 11: Use Case 2 - Codebase Research
```
Example: "How does authentication work in this project?"

Traditional:
- Read auth.ts (5k)
- Read middleware.ts (5k)
- Read users.ts (5k)
- Read config.ts (5k)
- Total: 20k tokens

Navigator:
- Use Task agent (explores in separate context)
- Returns summary (200 tokens)
- No main context pollution
- 99% reduction
```

---

### Tweet 12: Use Case 3 - Context Switching
```
Example: Working on multiple features

Traditional:
- Feature A: Fill context (80k)
- Switch to Feature B: Restart, re-explain
- Lost all Feature A context

Navigator:
- Feature A: Create marker (compresses 80k â†’ 2k)
- Switch to Feature B: Clear context
- Resume Feature A: Load marker (2k â†’ restore full context)

Never lose progress.
```

---

### Tweet 13: Open Source & Try It

Navigator is MIT licensed. All code is public.

You can see exactly how it works:
- Skills architecture: github.com/alekspetrov/navigator/skills
- Templates: /templates
- Implementation: Full transparency

Install: /plugin install navigator
Docs: [future docs link]

Questions? Ask me anything ðŸ‘‡
```

## Alternative Opening (More Personal)

### Tweet 1 (Alternative):
```
I spent 6 months hitting Claude's context limits daily.

Session restarts. Lost context. Re-explaining the same codebase 4Ã— per day.

So I built Navigator to fix it.

Here's how it actually works (with real numbers):

```

## Key Transparency Points to Emphasize

1. **Honest about the mechanism**: Not magic, it's caching + lazy loading
2. **Real numbers from actual sessions**: 54k loaded, 529k reused
3. **Show the math**: 4k + 0.65k + 5-10k = ~15k, not 150k
4. **Explain progressive disclosure**: Descriptions vs instructions
5. **Validate the problem**: Traditional approach wastes tokens upfront
6. **Use case examples**: Show practical scenarios
7. **Open source**: MIT license, full transparency

## Replies to Expected Questions

### Q: "How is this different from just not loading docs?"
```
A: Most developers DO load docs, because Claude needs context to help.

The difference: Navigator loads a 4k index first, then fetches specific docs on-demand.

Without Navigator, you either:
1. Load everything (150k waste), or
2. Load nothing (Claude doesn't know what exists)

Navigator gives you option 3: Load index, fetch on-demand.
```

### Q: "Can't I just do this manually?"
```
A: Yes! Navigator automates what you could do manually.

The value:
- Skills auto-invoke (no manual commands)
- Context markers compress conversations
- Templates ensure consistency
- Self-improving (generates project-specific tools)

Think of it as git vs manual file copying. Same outcome, 10Ã— faster.
```

### Q: "Doesn't Claude Code already cache things?"
```
A: Exactly! Navigator is designed to optimize FOR Claude's caching.

Traditional approach loads 150k uncached tokens.
Navigator loads 4k + specific docs (all cached after first use).

Same caching mechanism, structured to maximize its efficiency.
```

### Q: "Is 92% reduction realistic for all projects?"
```
A: Depends on your project size.

Small project (10k total docs): ~70% reduction
Medium project (50k docs): ~85% reduction
Large project (150k+ docs): ~92% reduction

The bigger your docs, the bigger the savings.
Navigator shines on complex codebases.
```

### Q: "What's the catch?"
```
A: Honest answer: You need to structure your docs.

Navigator provides templates, but YOU create:
- DEVELOPMENT-README.md (navigator)
- Task docs (implementation plans)
- System docs (architecture)

Upfront work: ~2 hours setup
Payoff: Months of efficient development

Not magic. Just better organization + tooling.
```

## Hashtags (Pick 2-3 max)

- #AI
- #DeveloperTools
- #OpenSource
- #ClaudeCode
- #Productivity

**Recommendation**: Don't overuse hashtags. Let the content speak.

---

## Timing Strategy

**Best time to post** (for tech audience):
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 9-11 AM PST (when developers check Twitter)
- Avoid Mondays (inbox catch-up) and Fridays (checked out)

**Post thread in one go** (don't spread across hours)
- Better for algorithm
- Easier to read
- Higher completion rate

---

## Engagement Strategy

**After posting:**
1. Pin the thread to profile
2. Share in relevant communities:
   - r/ClaudeAI (Reddit)
   - Claude Code Discord
   - Dev.to
   - Hacker News (if gets traction)

3. Engage with replies within first hour (critical)
4. Add clarifications as needed
5. Consider follow-up thread in 1 week with user feedback

---

## A/B Test Versions

### Version A: Technical (Data-Driven)
Focus: Numbers, caching mechanism, progressive disclosure
Audience: Senior developers, engineering teams

### Version B: Problem-Solution (Pain-Driven)
Focus: Session restarts, lost context, daily frustration
Audience: Individual developers, beginners

### Version C: Demo-First (Show-Don't-Tell)
Lead with GIF/video of Navigator in action
Follow with explanation
Audience: Visual learners, skeptics

**Recommendation**: Version A (the thread above) is most honest and transparent.
