**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Purpose**: Announce Navigator v3.0 with transparency and real examples
**Tone**: Professional, honest, educational

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Copy-Paste Version

```
1/8

I've been working on a Claude Code plugin for 6 months.

Started as "JITD", now renamed to "Navigator".

Just hit v3.0. Figured I'd explain how it actually works (with real numbers).

ðŸ§µ

---

2/8

The problem I kept hitting: context limits.

I'd load my project docs (README, architecture, API reference, examples).
That's ~150k tokens gone before I even start working.

Then after 30 minutes, Claude would hit the 200k limit and I'd have to restart.

Lost context. Re-explain everything. Repeat.

---

3/8

The fix is simple: don't load everything upfront.

Load a small "index" first (4k tokens).
This index tells Claude what docs exist.
Then fetch specific docs only when needed.

Instead of 150k loaded upfront, I load ~12k total.
Same docs. Just on-demand.

---

4/8

Real example from this morning:

Me: "I need to implement authentication"
Claude: [Reads the index, sees auth docs exist]
Claude: [Loads auth-implementation.md - 5k tokens]
Claude: [Implements the feature]

Total tokens used: 9k (index + auth doc)
Not 150k.

That's it. No magic.

---

5/8

Claude Code caches documentation automatically.

So after I load the index once (4k tokens), it's cached.
Load a task doc (5k tokens), it's cached.
Access them again = 0 new tokens.

The "92% reduction" isn't a trick.
It's just: load less upfront + reuse via caching.

---

6/8

From my session this morning:

Messages: 18
Tokens loaded: 54k (once)
Tokens reused from cache: 529k
Cache efficiency: 100%

Without Navigator, that's 583k tokens = 3 session restarts.
With Navigator: 0 restarts.

These are real numbers from Claude Code's internals.

---

7/8

v3.0 is a complete rewrite:

1. Renamed from "JITD" to "Navigator" (clearer name)
2. Natural language interface (no slash commands)
3. Skills auto-invoke when you describe tasks
4. Self-improving (generates project-specific tools)

Breaking change, but cleaner architecture.

---

8/8

It's open source (MIT). All code is public.

Install: /plugin install navigator
Docs: https://alekspetrov.com/tools/navigator
GitHub: github.com/alekspetrov/navigator

If you hit context limits daily, might be worth trying.

Questions welcome ðŸ‘‡

## Alternative Opening (More Personal)

### Tweet 1 (Alternative):

```
I spent 6 months hitting Claude's context limits daily.

Session restarts. Lost context. Re-explaining the same codebase 4Ã— per day.

So I built Navigator to fix it.

Here's how it actually works (with real numbers):

```

## Key Transparency Points to Emphasize

1. **Honest about the mechanism**: Not magic, it's caching + lazy loading
2. **Real numbers from actual sessions**: 54k loaded, 529k reused
3. **Show the math**: 4k + 0.65k + 5-10k = ~15k, not 150k
4. **Explain progressive disclosure**: Descriptions vs instructions
5. **Validate the problem**: Traditional approach wastes tokens upfront
6. **Use case examples**: Show practical scenarios
7. **Open source**: MIT license, full transparency

---

## Replies to Expected Questions

### Q: "How is this different from just not loading docs?"

```
A: Most developers DO load docs, because Claude needs context to help.

The difference: Navigator loads a 4k index first, then fetches specific docs on-demand.

Without Navigator, you either:
1. Load everything (150k waste), or
2. Load nothing (Claude doesn't know what exists)

Navigator gives you option 3: Load index, fetch on-demand.
```

### Q: "Can't I just do this manually?"

```
A: Yes! Navigator automates what you could do manually.

The value:
- Skills auto-invoke (no manual commands)
- Context markers compress conversations
- Templates ensure consistency
- Self-improving (generates project-specific tools)

Think of it as git vs manual file copying. Same outcome, 10Ã— faster.
```

### Q: "Doesn't Claude Code already cache things?"

```
A: Exactly! Navigator is designed to optimize FOR Claude's caching.

Traditional approach loads 150k uncached tokens.
Navigator loads 4k + specific docs (all cached after first use).

Same caching mechanism, structured to maximize its efficiency.
```

### Q: "Is 92% reduction realistic for all projects?"

```
A: Depends on your project size.

Small project (10k total docs): ~70% reduction
Medium project (50k docs): ~85% reduction
Large project (150k+ docs): ~92% reduction

The bigger your docs, the bigger the savings.
Navigator shines on complex codebases.
```

### Q: "What's the catch?"

```
A: Honest answer: You need to structure your docs.

Navigator provides templates, but YOU create:
- DEVELOPMENT-README.md (navigator)
- Task docs (implementation plans)
- System docs (architecture)

Upfront work: ~2 hours setup
Payoff: Months of efficient development

Not magic. Just better organization + tooling.
```

## Visual Assets (Optional)

### Diagram 1: Token Usage Comparison

```
[â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] Traditional: 150k docs
[â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ                  ] Navigator: 12k docs

Context available for work:
Traditional: 50k (25%)
Navigator: 185k (92%)
```

### Diagram 2: Progressive Disclosure

```
Skill descriptions (always loaded):
[â– ] 650 tokens

Skill instructions (loaded on invoke):
[â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] 23.5k tokens

Result: 650 tokens upfront, not 24k
```

### Diagram 3: Session Timeline

```
Traditional:
[Work 30min] â†’ [Restart] â†’ [Work 30min] â†’ [Restart] â†’ ...

Navigator:
[Work all day â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’]

## Hashtags (Pick 2-3 max)

- #AI
- #DeveloperTools
- #OpenSource
- #ClaudeCode
- #Productivity

**Recommendation**: Don't overuse hashtags. Let the content speak.

---

## Timing Strategy

**Best time to post** (for tech audience):

- Tuesday-Thursday
- 9-11 AM PST (when developers check Twitter)
- Avoid Mondays (inbox catch-up) and Fridays (checked out)

**Post thread in one go** (don't spread across hours)

- Better for algorithm
- Easier to read
- Higher completion rate

---

## Engagement Strategy

**After posting:**

1. Pin the thread to profile
2. Share in relevant communities:

   - r/ClaudeAI (Reddit)
   - Claude Code Discord
   - Dev.to
   - Hacker News (if gets traction)

3. Engage with replies within first hour (critical)
4. Add clarifications as needed
5. Consider follow-up thread in 1 week with user feedback

---

## A/B Test Versions

### Version A: Technical (Data-Driven)

Focus: Numbers, caching mechanism, progressive disclosure
Audience: Senior developers, engineering teams

### Version B: Problem-Solution (Pain-Driven)

Focus: Session restarts, lost context, daily frustration
Audience: Individual developers, beginners

### Version C: Demo-First (Show-Don't-Tell)

Lead with GIF/video of Navigator in action
Follow with explanation
Audience: Visual learners, skeptics

**Recommendation**: Version A (the thread above) is most honest and transparent.

---

## Success Metrics

**Good launch:**

- 50+ likes on thread opener
- 10+ retweets
- 5+ meaningful replies
- 3+ GitHub stars

**Great launch:**

- 200+ likes
- 50+ retweets
- 20+ replies
- 20+ GitHub stars
- Featured in a newsletter

**Don't stress metrics**: Focus on clear communication. The right 50 people seeing this matters more than 5,000 wrong people.

---

**Final Note**: The goal isn't virality. It's clear communication to developers who face this problem daily. Be honest, show the math, welcome questions.
