## The Problem

I kept hitting context limits in Claude Code.

Session 5: Claude forgot a function I just wrote.
Session 7: It hallucinated a class that didn't exist.
Session 8: "Context limit reached."

I checked the stats: **150,000 tokens loaded**. I'd used **8,000**.

**I was wasting 94% of my context window on documentation I never needed.**

---

## The Realization

This wasn't a bug. This was my workflow.

**Every AI session, same pattern**:
1. Load all project docs at start ("better to have everything")
2. Context fills with 150k tokens
3. AI gets overwhelmed (signal lost in noise)
4. Forgets recent changes
5. Session crashes
6. Start over

**The default approach—bulk loading—was the problem.**

Then I read Anthropic's context engineering docs. Two insights changed everything:

**Context engineering ≠ Prompt engineering**

```
Prompt engineering: Single query → optimize prompt
Context engineering: Multi-turn agent → curate context
```

**From Anthropic's docs** (literally):
```
Available context:          Curated context:
├── Doc 1                  ├── Doc 1 ✓
├── Doc 2                  ├── Doc 2 ✓
├── Doc 3                  └── Tool 1 ✓
├── Doc 4
└── Tool 1

Load strategically, not everything.
```

**Navigator implements this for your codebase.**

---

## The Solution

**Context engineering: Strategic curation over bulk loading**

### How It Works

**Traditional approach** (bulk loading):
```
Session start → Load all docs (150k) → Context 75% full → Work cramped
Result: Sessions die in 5-7 exchanges
```

**Navigator** (context engineering):
```
Session start:
├── Navigator/index (2k) ✓ Map of what exists
└── Current task (3k) ✓ What you're working on

As you work:
├── Need architecture? Load it (5k)
├── Hit a bug? Load SOP (2k)
└── On-demand, strategic

Result: Sessions last 20+ exchanges
```

**Your project**: 150k tokens available
**Navigator loads**: 12k tokens
**You save**: 138k tokens (92%)

**For actual work. Not documentation overhead.**

---

## The Proof

**Not estimates. Verified via OpenTelemetry.**

## What Navigator Does

### Context Engineering Implementation

**1. Lazy Loading** - Load what you need, when you need it
```
Always: Navigator (2k) + Current task (3k)
On-demand: System docs (5k), SOPs (2k), Integration guides (3k)
Result: 90%+ context available for work
```

**2. Agent-Optimized Search** - Curated exploration, not bulk reading
```
Traditional: Read 20 files manually (80k tokens)
Navigator: Agent searches → Returns summary (8k tokens)
Savings: 90%
```

**3. Progressive Refinement** - Metadata first, details on-demand
```
Step 1: Load overview (2k)
Step 2: Identify needs
Step 3: Load relevant details (5k)
vs Loading everything: 15k
Savings: 53%
```

**4. Context Markers** - Compress decisions, not raw data
```
Full session: 200k tokens
Context marker: 5k tokens (decisions preserved)
Compression: 97.5%
```

**5. Autonomous Completion** - No manual prompts for predictable workflows
```
Feature complete → Auto-commits, updates docs, closes ticket
Zero "please commit" prompts
```

**These are patterns from Anthropic's context engineering docs, implemented.**

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Claude Code plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add alekspetrov/navigator
/plugin install navigator

# Restart Claude Code
```

### Initialize Your Project

```bash
# In your project directory
"Initialize Navigator in this project"
```

Creates documentation structure:
```
your-project/
└── .agent/
    ├── DEVELOPMENT-README.md    # Navigator (your index)
    ├── philosophy/               # Context engineering principles
    ├── tasks/                    # Implementation plans
    ├── system/                   # Architecture docs
    ├── sops/                     # Standard procedures
    └── .nav-config.json         # Configuration
```

**Works with any codebase**: Rust, Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.

### Start Your Session

**Every session begins**:
```
"Start my Navigator session"
```

This loads:
- Navigator/index (2k tokens) - Map of your docs
- Current task (if configured with PM tools) - 3k tokens
- **Nothing else yet** - 195k tokens available for work

### Use Context Engineering

```
# Agent-optimized search (vs reading 15 files)
"Find all authentication implementation files"
→ Agent returns curated summary (8k vs 80k tokens)

# Progressive refinement (vs loading full docs)
"How does the payment system work?"
→ Loads overview → Drills down only if needed

# Lazy loading (vs bulk loading)
"Implement user profile feature"
→ Loads task doc → Adds architecture only when relevant
```

**You'll see the difference in `/nav:stats`**

## What's New in v4.3.1 (Stable)

**Professional Upgrade Flow** - Zero template drift, seamless pre-release discovery

### Template Drift Eliminated

**Problem**: CLAUDE.md templates didn't match installed plugin version
```
Plugin updated to v4.3.0 → CLAUDE.md got v4.0.0 templates (bundled)
Result: Version mismatch, confusion
```

**Solution**: GitHub template fetching
```bash
nav-update-claude
→ ✓ Using template from GitHub (4.3.1)
→ CLAUDE.md always matches plugin version
→ Works with pre-releases
→ Offline fallback guaranteed
```

### Pre-Release Discovery

**Old behavior**: Pre-releases invisible to `/plugin update`

**New behavior**: Interactive choice
```
nav-upgrade

✅ You're on latest stable (v4.0.0)
⚡ Experimental available: v4.3.0

Options:
[1] Stay on stable (recommended)
[2] Try experimental (early adopter)
```

**Result**: Professional opt-in, single command, auto-synced templates

[Full v4.3.1 release notes](RELEASE-NOTES-v4.3.1.md)

## What's in v4.3.0 (Experimental)

**Multi-Claude Agentic Workflow Automation** - Parallel execution while maintaining 92% efficiency

### The Multi-Claude Concept

**Problem**: Single-Claude sequential execution
- One phase at a time (plan → impl → test → docs → review)
- Context fills up during long features
- No parallelism

**Solution**: Automated multi-Claude orchestration
```bash
./scripts/navigator-multi-claude.sh "Implement OAuth authentication"

Behind the scenes:
├── Orchestrator Claude: Creates plan (Phase 1)
├── Implementation Claude: Builds feature (Phase 2)
├── Testing Claude + Docs Claude: Parallel execution (Phase 3-4)
└── Review Claude: Analyzes changes (Phase 5)

Result: 12-21 minutes for complete feature
```

**Each Claude maintains 92% token efficiency** - Navigator principles applied to parallel architecture

### Status: Experimental

**Test results**: 30% full completion rate (3/10 workflows)
- ✅ Works: Simple features (1-2 file changes)
- ⚠️ Issues: Marker coordination timeouts, phase transitions
- 📋 Recommendation: Use with manual fallback readiness

**Try it**:
```bash
# Simple POC
./scripts/navigator-multi-claude-poc.sh "Add email validation"

# Full workflow
./scripts/navigator-multi-claude.sh TASK-42-feature-name
```

## What Was New in v3.4.0

**Direct Figma MCP Integration** - Preprocessing pattern proven

**Before v3.4.0**:
```
Claude orchestrates → Call MCP → Save temp files →
Call MCP again → Process files → 15-20 steps, 150k tokens
```

**After v3.4.0**:
```
Python connects to Figma MCP directly →
Preprocesses → Returns clean data → 1 step, 12k tokens
```

**Results**:
- 95% orchestration reduction (20 steps → 1)
- 92% token reduction (150k → 12k)
- 75% faster (15 min → 5 min)
- Deterministic output (no hallucinations)

**This proves**: Python for deterministic, LLM for semantic.

## Context Efficiency Score

Navigator tracks how well you're using context engineering:

```bash
/nav:stats
```

**Score calculation** (0-100):
- **Token savings** (40 points): 85%+ = 40 points
- **Cache efficiency** (30 points): 100% = 30 points
- **Context usage** (30 points): <40% = 30 points

**Interpretation**:
- **90-100**: Excellent - Optimal context engineering
- **80-89**: Good - Minor improvements possible
- **70-79**: Fair - Review lazy-loading strategy
- **<70**: Check anti-patterns (wasting context)

**Your metrics. Your project. Your savings.**

---

## Real Workflows

### Feature Implementation
```
Load:
├── Navigator (2k)
├── Task doc (3k)
└── System architecture (5k)

Total: 10k tokens
Session: 15 exchanges to completion
Context at end: 45% (comfortable)
```

### Bug Fix
```
Load:
├── Navigator (2k)
├── Debugging SOP (2k)
└── Agent search results (5k)

Total: 9k tokens
Session: 8 exchanges to fix
Context at end: 30% (plenty of room)
```

### Design Review
```
Load:
├── Navigator (2k)
├── Figma data (12k, preprocessed)
└── Design system docs (5k)

Total: 19k tokens
Session: Complete review in 5 minutes
vs Without preprocessing: 150k tokens, 15 minutes
```

**Efficiency is measurable. Check yours: `/nav:stats`**

---

## Why This Works

### Context Engineering Principles

From Anthropic's docs on context engineering:

**1. Curate, don't bulk load**
```
Available context (left) → Curated context (right)
Select what matters, not everything
```
**Navigator implements**: Lazy loading, agent search, progressive refinement

**2. Right tool for the job**
```
Deterministic tasks → Traditional code (Python, bash)
Semantic tasks → LLM (understanding, generation)
```
**Navigator implements**: Preprocessing (v3.4.0 Figma), autonomous completion

**3. Compress decisions, not data**
```
200k session → Extract decisions → 5k marker
Preserve what matters, not transcripts
```
**Navigator implements**: Context markers (97.5% compression)

📖 **[Context Engineering Philosophy](.agent/philosophy/CONTEXT-EFFICIENCY.md)**

---

## Project Management Integration

**Optional**: Connect Navigator to your PM tool

### Supported
- **Linear** (MCP) - Full integration
- **GitHub Issues** (gh CLI) - Via gh command
- **Jira** (API) - Via API calls
- **Manual** - Documentation-only mode (default)

### With PM Integration
```
"Start my Navigator session"

→ Checks Linear for assigned tasks
→ Loads current task implementation plan
→ Shows task context (3k tokens)
```

When done:
```
→ Auto-closes ticket
→ Archives documentation
→ Creates completion marker
```

**Zero-config works without PM tools.** Integration is enhancement, not requirement.

📖 **[PM Integration Guide](.agent/sops/integrations/linear-setup.md)**

---

## Configuration

Minimal configuration required. Works with defaults.

**Optional** `.agent/.nav-config.json`:
```json
{
  "version": "3.4.0",
  "project_management": "none",
  "task_prefix": "TASK",
  "auto_load_navigator": true,
  "compact_strategy": "conservative"
}
```

**Auto-detected**:
- Project type (JS, Python, Rust, etc.)
- Available integrations
- Documentation structure

**No setup required to start.**

---

## Documentation Structure

Navigator creates organized, discoverable documentation:

```
.agent/
├── DEVELOPMENT-README.md           # Navigator (always load first)
│
├── philosophy/                     # Context engineering principles
│   ├── CONTEXT-EFFICIENCY.md      # Why Navigator exists
│   ├── ANTI-PATTERNS.md            # Common mistakes
│   └── PATTERNS.md                 # Success patterns
│
├── tasks/                          # Implementation plans
│   ├── TASK-01-feature.md
│   └── archive/                    # Completed tasks
│
├── system/                         # Architecture docs
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── database.md
│   └── api-design.md
│
└── sops/                           # Standard procedures
    ├── debugging/
    ├── deployment/
    └── integrations/
```

**Strategy**:
- Always load: `DEVELOPMENT-README.md` (2k tokens)
- On-demand: Everything else (as needed)
- Result: 90%+ savings

---

## Examples

### Before Navigator

```bash
# Load all docs
cat .agent/**/*.md  # 150k tokens

# Session
User: "Add auth to API"
AI: "Here's the implementation..."
[5 exchanges]
AI: "What was that function you just wrote?"
[7 exchanges]
Error: Context limit reached

# Restart, start over
```

### With Navigator

```bash
# Strategic loading
"Start my Navigator session"  # 2k tokens

# Work
User: "Add auth to API"
Navigator: Loads task doc (3k) + architecture on-demand (5k)
AI: "Here's the implementation following your patterns..."
[20 exchanges, feature complete]

Context usage: 35%
Efficiency: 94/100
Time saved: 42 minutes
```

**Try it: Install Navigator, check `/nav:stats` after your first session.**

### Example Output

```bash
🎯 Navigator Multi-Claude Workflow
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 1: Planning (Orchestrator)
✅ Plan created: .agent/tasks/task-23-plan.md

Phase 2: Implementation
✅ Implementation complete

Phase 3 & 4: Parallel Testing + Documentation
✅ Testing complete (41s)
✅ Documentation complete (53s)
✅ All quality gates passed

Phase 5: Review
✅ Review complete: APPROVED (Quality: 9/10)

Phase 6: Integration
✅ Changes committed
✅ PR created: https://github.com/user/repo/pull/42

Phase 7: PM Integration
✅ Ticket #23 closed

✅ Multi-Claude Workflow Complete
Total time: 7m 14s
```

### Advanced Configuration

**Custom phase timeouts**:
```bash
# Edit wait_for_file() timeout in script
local timeout=300  # 5 minutes default
```

**Enable/disable phases**:
```bash
# Comment out phases in main() function
# Skip documentation phase example:
# docs_output=$(claude -p ...) &  # ← Comment this out
```

**PM Integration**:
- Works with GitHub Issues by default
- Requires `gh` CLI authenticated
- Task ID must match format: `TASK-<number>`

### Troubleshooting

**Timeout errors**:
- Check `.agent/tasks/*-failed` files for error details
- Increase timeout in `wait_for_file()` function
- Sub-Claude logs available in workflow output

**Missing task file**:
```bash
# Ensure task file exists
ls .agent/tasks/TASK-23*.md

# Task file must start with "# TASK-XX: Title"
```

**PM integration fails**:
```bash
# Verify gh CLI auth
gh auth status

# Check task ID format (must be TASK-<number>)
./scripts/navigator-multi-claude.sh TASK-23-feature  # ✅ Good
./scripts/navigator-multi-claude.sh add-feature      # ❌ Bad
```

### Performance Metrics

Real-world example (TASK-22: Simple Console Logger):

| Phase | Duration | Token Savings |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Planning | 58s | 75% (using Explore agent) |
| Implementation | 1m 44s | 65% (pattern analysis via agent) |
| Testing | 41s | 70% (test pattern discovery) |
| Documentation | 53s | 68% (doc style matching) |
| Review | 2m 45s | 80% (multi-file analysis) |
| **Total** | **7m 14s** | **~70% average** |

### Version History

- **v4.3.0**: Task agent delegation in all phases
- **v4.2.0**: Failure reporting + PM integration (Phase 7)
- **v4.1.0**: Parallel testing + documentation
- **v4.0.0**: Initial multi-Claude POC
