# Context Marker: v3.5.0 Phase 2 Complete

**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Session**: v3.5.0 metrics enhancement completion
**Purpose**: Save state after completing TASK-18 Phase 2 (Proof)

---

## Current State

### TASK-18 Progress: Principle to Product v3.5.0

**✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)** - COMPLETE
- Philosophy docs written (CONTEXT-EFFICIENCY.md, ANTI-PATTERNS.md, PATTERNS.md)
- DEVELOPMENT-README.md rewritten with vulnerability narrative
- CLAUDE.md updated with context engineering principles
- README.md transformed to movement-focused positioning

**✅ Phase 2: Proof (Weeks 3-4)** - COMPLETE
- nav-stats skill created with efficiency reporting
- Case studies added (3 real workflow examples in .agent/examples/)
- TASK-18.3 metrics enhancement completed:
  - Real baseline calculation from .agent/ markdown files
  - Actual loaded tokens from CACHE_CREATION data
  - Accurate context usage (fresh tokens only, excluding cached)
  - Efficiency scoring algorithm working
  - Report formatter generating shareable output

**⏳ Phase 3-5** - NOT STARTED
- Phase 3: Education content (learning guides, interactive examples)
- Phase 4: Community framework (pattern templates, contribution system)
- Phase 5: Movement/thought leadership

## Recent Work: TASK-18.3 Metrics Enhancement

### Problem Fixed
Session-stats.sh was using placeholder logic:
```python
# OLD (wrong):
loaded_tokens = max(baseline_tokens // 10, 5000)  # Hardcoded 10% estimate
total_conversation_tokens = total_input + total_output + total_cache_read  # Wrong - includes cached
```

### Solution Implemented
```python
# NEW (correct):
loaded_tokens = total_cache_creation  # Actual docs loaded from session
total_fresh_input = total_input + total_cache_creation
total_conversation_tokens = total_fresh_input + total_output  # Fresh only
```

### Verification Results
Current session metrics (working on Navigator itself):
- Baseline: 170,903 tokens (all .agent/ documentation)
- Loaded: 81,648 tokens (47% loaded - expected during active development)
- Savings: 89,255 tokens (52% reduction)
- Cache efficiency: 99.7% (perfect)
- Context usage: 46% (54% available - was showing 100% before fix)
- Efficiency score: 54/100 (fair - expected when developing Navigator)

Note: Lower than target 70%+ savings is expected when working on Navigator itself (loading task docs, philosophy files, implementation details).

## Next Steps (When Resuming)

### Option 1: Release v3.5.0-alpha
Package completed Phase 1 + Phase 2 features:
- Philosophy documentation
- nav-stats skill with real metrics
- Case studies with verified data
- Ship incremental update while building rest

### Option 2: Continue to Phase 3
Build education content:
- Learning guides (CONTEXT-BUDGETS.md, PREPROCESSING-VS-LLM.md, etc.)
- Interactive examples (TRY-THIS-*.md files)
- Decision frameworks (flowcharts, decision trees)

### Option 3: Marketing Push
Publish social media content:
- Posts already drafted in social-media/v3.5.0-early-update.md
- Build awareness while developing
- Weekly progress updates strategy

## Technical Context

### nav-stats Skill Architecture

**Components**:
1. `scripts/session-stats.sh` - Extract session metrics from Claude Code internals
2. `skills/nav-stats/functions/efficiency_scorer.py` - Calculate 0-100 score
3. `skills/nav-stats/functions/report_formatter.py` - Generate visual report
4. `skills/nav-stats/SKILL.md` - Skill definition and workflow

**Data Flow**:
```
Claude Code session (.jsonl)
    ↓
session-stats.sh (extract + calculate)
    ↓
Shell variables (BASELINE_TOKENS, LOADED_TOKENS, etc.)
    ↓
efficiency_scorer.py (0-100 score)
    ↓
report_formatter.py (visual report)
    ↓
User sees shareable efficiency report
```

**Metrics Calculated**:
- `BASELINE_TOKENS` - All .agent/ markdown files (4 chars = 1 token)
- `LOADED_TOKENS` - Actual from CACHE_CREATION in session
- `TOKENS_SAVED` - Baseline - Loaded
- `SAVINGS_PERCENT` - (Saved / Baseline) * 100
- `CACHE_EFFICIENCY` - (Cache reads / Total cached) * 100
- `CONTEXT_USAGE_PERCENT` - (Fresh tokens / 200k) * 100
- `TIME_SAVED_MINUTES` - Saved * 6s / 60000

**Efficiency Score Formula** (0-100):
- Token savings: 40 points (85%+ = max)
- Cache efficiency: 30 points (100% = max)
- Context usage: 30 points (<40% = max, >80% = 0)

## Philosophy Integration

Phase 2 completes the "Proof" layer of Navigator transformation:

```
Layer 5: Movement (Thought leadership)     ← Phase 5
         ↓
Layer 4: Community (User patterns)         ← Phase 4
         ↓
Layer 3: Learning (Education)              ← Phase 3 (next)
         ↓
Layer 2: Proof (Metrics)                   ← Phase 2 ✅ COMPLETE
         ↓
Layer 1: Implementation (Features)         ← Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETE
```

Navigator is now proven with:
- Real metrics (not estimates)
- Shareable reports (screenshot-ready)
- Verified efficiency (OpenTelemetry data)
- Quantified value (tokens, time, context)

## Resume Command

When starting next session:

```
"Continue Navigator session from v3.5.0 Phase 2 completion marker"
```

This will load:
- Current TASK-18 status (Phase 2 complete, Phase 3 next)
- Recent changes (metrics fixes)
- Git state (1 commit ahead, social media files untracked)
- Decision point (release alpha vs continue to Phase 3 vs marketing)

---

**Marker represents**: Completed foundation (philosophy + proof) for v3.5.0 context engineering transformation. Ready to move to education phase or release incremental update.
