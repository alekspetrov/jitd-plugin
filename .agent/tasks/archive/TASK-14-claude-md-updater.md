# TASK-14: CLAUDE.md Updater Skill

**Status**: ✅ Completed (v3.1.1)
**Completed**: 2025-10-20
**Commits**: 8f2bdea, 6a6f64d, [security commit]

---

## Context

**Problem**:
Users migrating from v1/v2 to v3 had outdated CLAUDE.md files still referencing slash commands (`/nav:start`) instead of natural language, causing Claude to not understand Navigator workflow. Manual updates lost project-specific customizations.

**Goal**:
Create automated migration skill that updates CLAUDE.md to v3.1 while preserving all project customizations.

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Detect CLAUDE.md version (outdated/current/unknown)
- [x] Extract project-specific customizations
- [x] Apply v3.1 template
- [x] Preserve tech stack, standards, forbidden actions
- [x] Non-destructive (backup before changes)
- [x] Show diff for user review

---

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Skill Structure
**Goal**: Create nav-update-claude skill scaffold

**Completed**:
- Created `skills/nav-update-claude/` directory
- Created `skill.md` with 7-step workflow
- Created `functions/` directory for predefined functions
- Registered skill in `plugin.json`

**Files**:
- `skills/nav-update-claude/skill.md` - Main skill definition
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Skill registration

### Phase 2: Version Detection
**Goal**: Identify outdated CLAUDE.md files

**Completed**:
- Built `version_detector.py` with heuristics
- Checks for version markers (Navigator Version: X.X.X)
- Detects slash command references (`/nav:start`)
- Detects natural language examples
- Returns: outdated | current | unknown

**Files**:
- `skills/nav-update-claude/functions/version_detector.py` (127 lines)

**Detection Logic**:
- Has version marker → Parse and compare
- Has `/nav:` commands → outdated
- Has natural language + skills explanation → current
- Has Navigator markers but unclear → heuristics
- No Navigator markers → unknown

### Phase 3: Customization Extraction
**Goal**: Parse CLAUDE.md and extract project-specific content

**Completed**:
- Built `claude_updater.py` with extract mode
- Extracts project name from title
- Extracts description from Context section
- Extracts tech stack (parses comma-separated list)
- Extracts custom code standards (filters defaults)
- Extracts custom forbidden actions (filters defaults)
- Extracts PM tool configuration
- Extracts custom sections not in template

**Files**:
- `skills/nav-update-claude/functions/claude_updater.py` (286 lines)

**Extraction Output** (JSON):
```json
{
  "project_name": "TestProject",
  "description": "Brief project description",
  "tech_stack": ["React", "TypeScript", "Node.js"],
  "code_standards": ["Custom rule: Always use hooks"],
  "forbidden_actions": ["Custom: No inline styles"],
  "pm_tool": "github",
  "custom_sections": {
    "Deployment": "Custom deployment content..."
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Template Application
**Goal**: Generate updated CLAUDE.md with v3.1 template

**Completed**:
- Built generate mode in `claude_updater.py`
- Loads v3.1 template from `templates/CLAUDE.md`
- Replaces placeholders with extracted data
- Appends custom standards after defaults
- Appends custom forbidden actions
- Inserts custom sections at end
- Updates Navigator version marker to 3.1.0

**Template Replacements**:
- `[Project Name]` → `project_name`
- `[Brief project description...]` → `description`
- `[List your technologies...]` → `tech_stack` (comma-separated)
- PM tool configuration → `pm_tool`

### Phase 5: Testing
**Goal**: Validate extraction and generation

**Completed**:
- Created test CLAUDE.md with v2.0 format
- Tested version detection (returned "outdated" ✓)
- Tested extraction (captured all customizations ✓)
- Tested generation (applied v3.1 template ✓)
- Fixed regex bug in `extract_section` (f-string issue)
- Fixed double emoji in forbidden actions
- Verified custom sections preserved

**Test Results**:
```bash
# Version detection
$ python3 version_detector.py test-old-claude.md
outdated

# Extraction
$ python3 claude_updater.py extract test-old-claude.md
{
  "project_name": "TestProject",
  "tech_stack": ["React", "TypeScript", "Node.js"],
  "code_standards": ["Custom rule: Always use hooks"],
  "forbidden_actions": ["Custom: No inline styles"]
}

# Generation
$ python3 claude_updater.py generate --customizations ... --template ... --output ...
✓ Generated test-new-claude.md
```

### Phase 6: Documentation
**Goal**: Update Navigator docs and README

**Completed**:
- Updated `.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md` with TASK-14 entry
- Updated README.md installation format (long → short)
- Changed `github.com/alekspetrov/navigator` → `alekspetrov/navigator`
- Simplified installation instructions
- Added SECURITY.md policy

**Files Modified**:
- `.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md` (added TASK-14)
- `README.md` (2 installation sections updated)
- `SECURITY.md` (new file)

## Technical Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Chosen | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Language | Bash vs Python | Python | Better regex, JSON parsing, cross-platform |
| Extraction method | Regex vs Markdown parser | Regex | No dependencies, flexible patterns |
| Backup strategy | Git stash vs File copy | File copy (`.backup`) | Simpler, visible to user |
| Diff display | Auto-apply vs Show first | Show first | User reviews before accepting |

---

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Regex Pattern in f-string
**Issue**: `rf'^#{1,2}\s+{re.escape(header)}.*?$'` → Literal `{1,2}` instead of quantifier

**Fix**: Split pattern into parts: `r'^#{1,2}\s+' + re.escape(header) + r'.*?$'`

**Impact**: Version detection and extraction completely broken

### Bug 2: Double Emoji in Forbidden Actions
**Issue**: Extracting `"❌ Custom: No inline styles"` → Outputting `"❌ ❌ Custom: No inline styles"`

**Fix**: Strip emoji twice: `line.lstrip('❌- ').strip()` then `action.lstrip('❌ ')`

**Impact**: Minor formatting issue

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- [x] Tested on v1.x CLAUDE.md format
- [x] Tested on v2.x CLAUDE.md format
- [x] Tested on custom project CLAUDE.md
- [x] Verified backup creation
- [x] Verified customizations preserved
- [x] Verified natural language examples added
- [x] Verified slash commands removed

### Edge Cases
- [x] CLAUDE.md with no version marker
- [x] CLAUDE.md with custom sections
- [x] CLAUDE.md with unusual formatting
- [x] CLAUDE.md that's already v3.1

---

## User Documentation

### Usage
```
User: "Update my CLAUDE.md to v3.1"

Skill:
1. Detects version (outdated)
2. Creates backup (CLAUDE.md.backup)
3. Extracts customizations
4. Generates new file with v3.1 template
5. Shows diff for review
6. Confirms completion
```

### Rollback
```bash
mv CLAUDE.md.backup CLAUDE.md
```

- Test-driven approach caught bugs early
- JSON intermediate format made debugging easy
- Backup strategy gave users confidence

**What Could Improve**:
- Could add dry-run mode (`--preview` flag)
- Could detect more edge cases (HTML in CLAUDE.md)
- Could validate output with schema checker

**Reusable Patterns**:
- Markdown section extraction logic
- Template placeholder replacement
- Customization preservation strategy
- Non-destructive file updates

## Related Tasks

**Depends On**:
- TASK-12: v3.0 Skills-Only Migration (provides natural language context)

**Enables**:
- Future template updates (can reuse extractor)
- Project onboarding (detect non-Navigator CLAUDE.md)
