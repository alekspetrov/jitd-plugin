# TASK-18 Corrections: Plugin-First Approach

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Critical**: Apply context engineering principles from Anthropic docs

---

## 🎯 Key Realizations from Context Engineering Images

### Image 1: System Prompt Calibration

**Spectrum**: Too specific ← **Just right** → Too vague

**"Just right" example** (Claude's Bakery customer support):
- Framework, not rigid rules
- "Identify core issue → Gather context → Provide clear resolution"
- Guidelines, not exhaustive checklists
- Escalate to human when needed

**Applied to Navigator**:
- ❌ **Too specific**: "Run exactly these 15 steps in order"
- ✅ **Just right**: "Start session → Navigate to what you need → Load on-demand"
- ❌ **Too vague**: "Be helpful and efficient"

---

### Image 2: Context Engineering for Agents

**Core principle**: **Curation > Loading everything**

**Possible context** (left) → **Curated context** (right)
- Many docs available → Load Doc1, Doc2 only
- Many tools available → Provide Tool1, Tool2 only
- **Strategic selection based on task**

**This is literally Navigator's architecture.**

---

## 🔧 Critical Corrections for TASK-18

### 1. Navigator is a Plugin (Not SaaS)

**Reality**:
- Users install on their machines
- Works with their projects (any codebase)
- No API keys required (unless they configure PM tools)
- No central server
- No user-specific data

**Implications for TASK-18**:

#### Philosophy Docs Must Be Portable ✅
```markdown
# CONTEXT-EFFICIENCY.md

## The Problem I Kept Hitting

I was working on [any project]... ← NOT "Navigator's codebase"
I loaded all my docs... ← NOT "our docs"
```

**Correct**: Use "you/your" for user's project
**Wrong**: Use "we/our" for Navigator's codebase

---

#### Case Studies Must Be Generic ✅
```markdown
# FEATURE-IN-3-STEPS.md

Example: Adding authentication to e-commerce app
  ← NOT "Adding feature to Navigator"

Your project: 150k tokens if loaded upfront
Your usage: 12k tokens with Navigator
  ← NOT Navigator-specific metrics
```

---

#### Learning Content Must Apply to Any Codebase ✅
```markdown
# CONTEXT-BUDGETS.md

Your project documentation:
├── README.md
├── docs/
└── .agent/ (Navigator adds this)

How to budget your 200k context:
- Your system: ~50k (docs, architecture)
- Your work: ~100k (code, changes)
- Navigator overhead: ~12k (guidance)
  ← Works for ANY project
```

---

#### Metrics Must Be User's Project ✅
```markdown
/nav:stats output:

Your Project Efficiency
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Documentation in project:    150k tokens (baseline)
Loaded this session:          12k tokens
Tokens saved:                138k (92%)

  ← These are USER'S docs, not Navigator's
```

---

### 2. Automation Must Be Zero-Config

**From Image 1 principle**: "Just right" = helpful framework, not rigid process

**Applied to Navigator**:

#### ✅ Auto-detect, Don't Ask
```bash
# GOOD: Auto-detect project type
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  project_type="JavaScript"
elif [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then
  project_type="Rust"
fi

# BAD: Ask user
echo "What type of project is this? (1) JS (2) Python (3) Rust"
```

---

#### ✅ Smart Defaults, Override if Needed
```bash
# GOOD: Work without config
if [ -f ".agent/.nav-config.json" ]; then
  load_config  # User customized
else
  use_defaults  # Works immediately
fi

# BAD: Require configuration
if [ ! -f ".agent/.nav-config.json" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Please run setup first"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

#### ✅ Graceful Degradation
```bash
# GOOD: Optional enhancements
if command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
  pm_tool="GitHub Issues (via gh CLI)"
else
  pm_tool="Manual documentation"  # Still works
fi

# BAD: Hard requirements
if ! command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: gh CLI required"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

### 3. Instructions Must Be Clear & Minimal

**From Image 1**: Customer support prompt is ~400 words, not 4,000

**Applied to Navigator**:

#### Philosophy Docs: ~3-4k tokens each ✅
**NOT**: Comprehensive encyclopedia
**YES**: Core insight + examples + when to use

#### Learning Guides: ~2-3k tokens each ✅
**NOT**: Academic textbook
**YES**: Problem → Pattern → Proof → Practice

#### Commands: One-line invocation ✅
```bash
# GOOD
"Start my Navigator session"

# BAD
"Please initialize Navigator by loading the development readme
and checking for assigned tasks from the project management
system if configured, then display session statistics..."
```

---

### 4. Context Curation is THE Feature

**From Image 2**: Right side shows **curated context window**

**Navigator's curation strategy**:

```
Available in .agent/:
├── philosophy/ (3 files, ~10k tokens)
├── learning/ (4 files, ~10k tokens)
├── system/ (5 files, ~25k tokens)
├── tasks/ (10 files, ~30k tokens)
├── sops/ (8 files, ~20k tokens)
└── examples/ (3 files, ~8k tokens)

Total available: ~103k tokens

Loaded in typical session:
├── DEVELOPMENT-README.md (~2k)
├── Current task (~3k)
└── Relevant system doc (~5k)

Total loaded: ~10k tokens (90% savings)
```

**This curation IS the product.**

---

## 🎯 Corrections to Apply

### TASK-18.1: Philosophy Documentation

**Add section**: "How Navigator Curates Context"

```markdown
## Navigator's Curation Strategy

**Available**: All .agent/ documentation (~100k+ tokens)
**Loaded**: Navigator (2k) + Current task (3k) + System (if needed, 5k)
**Saved**: 90%+ of context window for your actual work

This is **context engineering**: Strategic selection over bulk loading.

Analogy: Library vs. Carrying Books
- Don't carry every book from the library
- Bring catalog (navigator)
- Check out what you need (on-demand)
- Return when done (compact)
```

---

### TASK-18.2: Narrative Rewrite

**Update voice**: User's project, not Navigator's

**Before** (Navigator-centric):
```markdown
Navigator reduces token usage by 92%
```

**After** (User-centric):
```markdown
Your project docs: 150k tokens
With Navigator: 12k tokens loaded
You save: 92% of context for actual work
```

---

### TASK-18.3: Metrics Enhancement

**Ensure baseline is user's project**:

```bash
# Calculate baseline from USER'S docs
calculate_baseline() {
  local baseline=0

  # User's docs (not Navigator's)
  if [ -d ".agent" ]; then
    baseline=$(find .agent -name "*.md" -type f -exec wc -c {} + | \
               awk '{sum+=$1} END {print int(sum/4)}')
  fi

  # Project README
  if [ -f "README.md" ]; then
    baseline=$((baseline + $(wc -c < README.md) / 4))
  fi

  echo $baseline
}
```

---

### TASK-18.5: Learning Content

**Each guide must show curation in action**:

```markdown
# CONTEXT-BUDGETS.md

## Exercise: See Curation vs. Bulk Loading

### Without Navigator (Bulk Loading)
```bash
# Load everything at session start
cat .agent/**/*.md  # 100k+ tokens
# Result: Context full, AI overwhelmed
```

### With Navigator (Curation)
```bash
"Start Navigator session"
# Loads: Navigator (2k)
# Available: Everything else (on-demand)
# Result: 98k tokens available for work
```

**This is context engineering: Curate, don't bulk load.**
```

---

### TASK-18.7: Pattern Library

**Pattern Template must emphasize curation**:

```markdown
# Pattern: [Name]

## Context Engineering Principle
[Which curation strategy this uses]
- Lazy loading?
- Progressive refinement?
- Strategic selection?

## Problem
[What fails with bulk loading]

## Solution
[How curation fixes it]

## Proof
[Metrics: tokens saved, efficiency gained]
```

---

### TASK-18.9: Manifesto

**Lead with context engineering**:

```markdown
# The Context Efficiency Manifesto

## The Problem

AI tools load everything upfront. "Just in case."

Result: 70-90% of context wasted on irrelevant data.

## The Realization

**Context engineering beats bulk loading.**

From Anthropic's docs:
- Prompt engineering: One query, optimize prompt
- Context engineering: Multi-turn agent, curate context

Navigator implements context engineering for your codebase.

## The Principle

**Strategic curation > Bulk loading**

Not "load everything just in case"
Not "better safe than sorry"

Curate what's relevant. Load on-demand. Save context for work.

## The Proof

[User metrics, not Navigator's]

Your project: 150k tokens available
Navigator loaded: 12k tokens
Context saved for work: 138k (92%)

**Verified via OpenTelemetry, not estimates.**
```

---

## 🎯 Quality Gates

### Before Marking Any Task Complete

**Ask**:
1. Would this work for a Rust project? Python? JavaScript?
2. Does it assume Navigator's codebase or user's?
3. Can user install and use without configuration?
4. Are instructions clear enough for non-experts?
5. Does it show curation strategy explicitly?
6. Would Anthropic's context engineering docs approve?

**If any answer is no, revise before completing.**

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways for Implementation

### 1. Context Engineering is the Product ✅

**Not**: "Navigator has lazy loading feature"
**Is**: "Navigator implements context engineering for your codebase"

**From Anthropic docs**: Curation > Bulk loading
**Navigator proves**: 90%+ savings through strategic curation

---

### 2. "Just Right" Calibration ✅

**Too specific**: Rigid checklists, exhaustive rules
**Just right**: Framework + examples + when to escalate
**Too vague**: "Be efficient"

**All TASK-18 deliverables must hit "just right"**

---

### 3. Plugin Reality Check ✅

Every doc, command, and feature must work:
- ✅ On any machine (user's laptop)
- ✅ With any project (Rust, JS, Python, etc.)
- ✅ Without setup (or minimal setup)
- ✅ Without API keys (unless optional integrations)
- ✅ Offline (no network required for core features)

---

### 4. User-Centric Everything ✅

**All metrics are user's**:
- Your project: 150k tokens
- Your savings: 92%
- Your efficiency: 94/100
- Your time saved: 42 minutes

**Not Navigator's metrics.**

---
