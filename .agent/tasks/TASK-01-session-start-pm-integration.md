# TASK-01: Session Start Command and PM Integration

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Version**: 1.3.0
**Completed**: 2025-10-12

---

## Ticket

**Source**: Internal discussion
**Priority**: High
**Type**: Feature Enhancement

**Problem Statement**:
After plugin installation, users experienced:
1. Passive post-install UX - no guidance on next steps
2. Manual session initialization - had to remember to load navigator
3. No automated PM tool setup - Linear/GitHub required manual configuration
4. Weak CLAUDE.md enforcement - Claude sometimes missed workflow requirements

---

## Context

JITD plugin was functional but lacked onboarding flow. Users had to manually:
- Type "read @.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md" at every session start
- Remember JITD procedures
- Configure PM tools without guidance
- Use agents without prompting

This created friction and inconsistent adoption of JITD workflow.

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Session Start Command ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Create `/jitd-start` command for consistent session initialization

**Implementation**:
- Created `commands/jitd-start.md`
- Command loads navigator automatically
- Checks PM tool for assigned tasks
- Displays token optimization status
- Reminds about agent usage
- Shows what to do next

**Files Modified**:
- `commands/jitd-start.md` (NEW)

### Phase 2: PM Tool Auto-Configuration ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Guide users through PM tool setup during `/jitd-init`

**Implementation**:
- Added Step 6.5 to `/jitd-init` workflow
- Detects Linear MCP installation status
- Provides setup instructions with API key URL
- Auto-generates integration SOPs when configured
- Checks GitHub CLI installation and auth
- Offers alternatives (switch tool or use "none")

**For Linear**:
- Checks for MCP tools availability
- Shows installation command: `claude mcp add linear-server`
- Provides API key URL: https://linear.app/settings/api
- Generates `.agent/sops/integrations/linear-mcp.md` when configured

**For GitHub**:
- Checks if `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- Shows installation command for macOS/Linux/Windows
- Shows auth command: `gh auth login`
- Generates `.agent/sops/integrations/github-cli.md` when configured

**For Jira/GitLab**:
- Shows manual workflow instructions
- Explains automated integration not available yet
- Offers to switch to Linear/GitHub or use "none"

**Files Modified**:
- `commands/jitd-init.md` (added Step 6.5)

### Phase 3: Stronger CLAUDE.md Enforcement ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Ensure Claude always follows JITD workflow

**Implementation**:
- Added "SESSION START PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)" section
- Used strong enforcement language ("MUST", "NOT optional", "üö®")
- Required `/jitd-start` at every session start
- Updated slash commands reference to include `/jitd-start`
- Updated Quick Reference to emphasize session start

**Language Changes**:
- "CRITICAL" ‚Üí "CRITICAL - ENFORCE STRICTLY"
- Added mandatory protocol section
- Made navigator loading non-optional
- Clarified `/jitd-start` is for EVERY conversation

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/CLAUDE.md` (template for user projects)
- `CLAUDE.md` (this repo's config)

### Phase 4: Version Bump ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Release changes as 1.3.0

**Implementation**:
- Updated marketplace.json version
- Created release commit with detailed changelog
- Tagged v1.3.0
- Pushed to GitHub

**Files Modified**:
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (1.2.0 ‚Üí 1.3.0)

## Technical Decisions

### Why `/jitd-start` Instead of Auto-Loading?

**Decision**: Create explicit command rather than auto-load navigator

**Rationale**:
- Explicit > implicit (user knows what's happening)
- Allows checking PM tools and showing tasks
- Can display token optimization summary
- Provides guidance on next steps
- User can control when to start JITD workflow

**Alternative Considered**: Auto-load navigator at session start
- Rejected: No PM tool check, no task display, less user control

### Why Step 6.5 in `/jitd-init`?

**Decision**: Add PM tool setup between config creation and verification

**Rationale**:
- Config file exists, so we know user's PM tool choice
- Can immediately check if tool is configured
- Can generate SOPs right away
- User gets complete setup in one command
- Logical flow: configure ‚Üí verify ‚Üí guide

**Alternative Considered**: Separate `/jitd-setup-pm` command
- Rejected: Extra step, harder to discover, breaks flow

### Why Auto-Generate Integration SOPs?

**Decision**: Create SOPs automatically when PM tools detected

**Rationale**:
- Reduces manual documentation work
- Ensures consistent SOP structure
- Immediate value after setup
- Templates include common commands and troubleshooting
- Living documentation that user can customize

**Alternative Considered**: Provide generic PM tool docs
- Rejected: Not project-specific, no immediate value

## User Impact

### Before This Change
```
User: *starts new session*
User: "read @.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md and follow JITD"
Claude: *loads navigator, works correctly*

User: *next day, starts new session*
User: "implement feature X"
Claude: *may or may not load navigator first* ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

### After This Change
```
User: *starts new session*
User: /jitd-start
Claude: *loads navigator, checks Linear, shows tasks*
Claude: "You have 3 assigned tasks: LIN-45, LIN-47, LIN-50"

User: "work on LIN-45"
Claude: *loads task details, creates plan, follows JITD workflow*
```

**Token Savings**: Same 92% reduction, but now **consistently applied**

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Explicit session command**: `/jitd-start` makes workflow clear and actionable
2. **Auto-detection approach**: Checking for MCP/CLI before guidance is user-friendly
3. **SOP auto-generation**: Immediate value, reduces setup friction
4. **Strong enforcement language**: "MUST" and "MANDATORY" get attention

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Testing coverage**: Need to validate in real user projects before declaring complete
2. **Error handling**: Should add fallback if PM tool detection fails
3. **MCP detection**: Current approach checks for tools, could be more robust
4. **Documentation**: Need to update plugin README with new workflow

### Future Enhancements
1. **Proactive ticket loading**: `/jitd-start` could auto-create task docs for assigned issues
2. **Session state**: Track which tasks were worked on across sessions
3. **PM tool templates**: Provide project-specific Linear/GitHub workflows
4. **Health check**: `/jitd-status` command to verify setup is correct
