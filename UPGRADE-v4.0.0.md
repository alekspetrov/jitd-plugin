## What's New in v4.0

### Major Addition: Education Layer

v4.0 adds comprehensive learning content in `.agent/learning/`:

**Learning Guides** (4 guides):
- CONTEXT-BUDGETS.md - Token allocation strategies
- PREPROCESSING-VS-LLM.md - Right tool for the job
- PROGRESSIVE-REFINEMENT.md - Metadata → details pattern
- TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION.md - Complete strategy reference

**Interactive Examples** (3 exercises):
- TRY-THIS-LAZY-LOADING.md - Experience 90%+ savings
- TRY-THIS-AGENT-SEARCH.md - Agent vs manual comparison
- TRY-THIS-MARKERS.md - 97% compression practice

**Decision Frameworks** (3 quick refs):
- WHEN-TO-COMPACT.md - Context management flowchart
- AGENT-VS-MANUAL.md - File reading decisions
- PREPROCESSING-DECISION-TREE.md - Tool selection matrix

### What Hasn't Changed

✅ **All existing functionality works identically**:
- Natural language interface
- Skills (nav-start, nav-marker, nav-compact, nav-task, nav-sop, nav-stats, etc.)
- Context markers
- Agents
- Session statistics

✅ **Your customizations are preserved**:
- CLAUDE.md modifications
- Custom skills
- Project-specific configuration
- Existing markers

## Upgrade Options

### Option 1: Automatic Upgrade (Recommended)

**Steps**:
```
1. Update Navigator plugin
/plugin update navigator

2. Update your project (automatic migration)
"Update my project to Navigator v4.0"
```

**What happens**:
1. Navigator detects your project version
2. Creates `.agent/learning/` structure
3. Adds learning guides, examples, frameworks
4. Updates DEVELOPMENT-README with learning references
5. Preserves all existing content and customizations

**Time**: 30 seconds
**Manual intervention**: None required

---

### Option 2: Manual Steps (If automatic fails)

**Step 1: Update Plugin**
```bash
/plugin update navigator
```

**Step 2: Verify Version**
```
"Show Navigator version"
Expected output: 4.0.0
```

**Step 3: Re-initialize Navigator** (safe, non-destructive)
```
"Initialize Navigator in this project"
```

Navigator will:
- Add missing v4.0 content
- Skip existing files (no overwrite)
- Update references where needed

**Step 4: Verify Upgrade**
```
ls -la .agent/learning/
# Should show: CONTEXT-BUDGETS.md, PREPROCESSING-VS-LLM.md, etc.
```

---

### Option 3: Fresh Installation (New projects only)

**For new projects**:
```
/plugin install navigator
"Initialize Navigator in this project"
```

You get v4.0 by default with all features.

---

## Verification Checklist

After upgrade, verify:

- [ ] **Plugin version**: "Show Navigator version" → 4.0.0
- [ ] **Learning content exists**: `ls .agent/learning/` shows guides
- [ ] **Navigator loads**: "Start my Navigator session" works
- [ ] **Skills work**: "Create a context marker" works
- [ ] **Stats work**: "Show me my session statistics" works
- [ ] **Existing markers preserved**: `ls .context-markers/` shows old markers

## What to Explore First

### For Teams

**Goal**: Onboard new developers faster

1. **Share philosophy** (30 min read):
   - `.agent/philosophy/CONTEXT-EFFICIENCY.md`
   - `.agent/philosophy/ANTI-PATTERNS.md`
   - `.agent/philosophy/PATTERNS.md`

2. **Run interactive examples** (40 min):
   - `.agent/learning/examples/TRY-THIS-LAZY-LOADING.md`
   - `.agent/learning/examples/TRY-THIS-AGENT-SEARCH.md`
   - `.agent/learning/examples/TRY-THIS-MARKERS.md`

3. **Bookmark frameworks** (ongoing reference):
   - `.agent/learning/frameworks/` folder
   - Quick reference during work

**Result**: New developers productive in 2-4 hours vs 2-3 days

---

### For Individual Developers

**Goal**: Master context efficiency principles

**Week 1**: Read one guide per day
- Monday: CONTEXT-BUDGETS.md (8 min)
- Tuesday: PREPROCESSING-VS-LLM.md (10 min)
- Wednesday: PROGRESSIVE-REFINEMENT.md (9 min)
- Thursday: TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION.md (12 min)
- Friday: Try one interactive example (12 min)

**Week 2**: Apply to real work
- Use decision frameworks during development
- Check session stats after each session
- Share efficiency scores with team

**Result**: 70%+ efficiency scores consistently

---

### For Managers/Tech Leads

**Goal**: Demonstrate ROI

1. **Before v4.0**: Collect baseline metrics
   - Context crashes per day
   - Session restart frequency
   - Token usage estimates

2. **After v4.0**: Show improvements
   - Run "Show me my session statistics" after sessions
   - Screenshot efficiency reports (90%+ scores)
   - Track time saved (nav-stats reports minutes)

3. **Share results**:
   - "Navigator saved 42 minutes this session"
   - "92% token reduction vs upfront loading"
   - "3x longer sessions without restart"

**Result**: Clear ROI justification for team adoption

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Will my existing markers work?

**A**: Yes. All existing markers are preserved and work identically. No migration needed.

---

### Q: Do I need to read all the learning content?

**A**: No. It's optional educational material. Your workflows continue unchanged.

**Use cases for learning content**:
- Onboarding new team members
- Teaching Navigator principles
- Mastering optimization strategies
- Quick reference during work

---

### Q: What if automatic upgrade fails?

**A**: Use Option 2 (manual steps). Navigator's re-initialization is safe and non-destructive. It only adds missing content.

---

### Q: Can I stay on v3.x?

**A**: Yes. v3.x continues to work. However:
- v4.0 adds zero breaking changes
- Learning content helps team adoption
- Education layer reduces onboarding time 80%

**Recommendation**: Upgrade at your next convenient maintenance window.

---

### Q: How do I teach v4.0 to my team?

**A**: Three-tier approach:

**Tier 1 (Everyone)**: 10-minute intro
- Read CONTEXT-EFFICIENCY.md philosophy
- Try TRY-THIS-LAZY-LOADING.md exercise
- Bookmark frameworks folder

**Tier 2 (Power users)**: 1-hour deep dive
- Read all 4 learning guides
- Complete all 3 interactive examples
- Practice applying frameworks

**Tier 3 (Champions)**: Ongoing mastery
- Study TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION.md thoroughly
- Achieve 85%+ efficiency scores
- Create team-specific patterns

---

### Q: Does v4.0 change how I use Navigator daily?

**A**: No. Your daily workflow is identical:

```
Before v4.0:
1. "Start my Navigator session"
2. Work on features
3. "Create a context marker"
4. "Clear context and preserve marker"

After v4.0:
[Exactly the same]

Optionally:
5. "Show me my session statistics" (enhanced in v3.5.0, still works)
6. Reference .agent/learning/frameworks/ for decisions
```

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

**Unlikely to need**, but if you want to rollback:

```bash
# Downgrade plugin
/plugin install navigator@3.2.0

# Remove v4.0 content (optional)
rm -rf .agent/learning/

# Restore DEVELOPMENT-README (if needed)
git checkout HEAD~1 .agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md
```

**Note**: Your project continues working even without rollback. v4.0 is purely additive.
