# Navigator CLAUDE.md Updater Skill

Update project's CLAUDE.md to latest Navigator version (v3.1) while preserving project-specific customizations.

## When to Invoke

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Says "update my CLAUDE.md", "migrate CLAUDE.md to v3"
- Says "update Navigator configuration", "fix my CLAUDE.md"
- Mentions outdated commands like "/nav:start" and wants to upgrade
- Complains that Claude doesn't understand Navigator workflow

**DO NOT invoke** if:
- CLAUDE.md already references v3.1 and natural language commands
- User is editing CLAUDE.md for project-specific reasons (not Navigator updates)
- Working on plugin's root CLAUDE.md (not user projects)

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Detect Current CLAUDE.md Version

Check if CLAUDE.md exists and detect version:

```bash
if [ ! -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
  echo "❌ No CLAUDE.md found in current directory"
  echo ""
  echo "Run 'Initialize Navigator in this project' first."
  exit 1
fi
```

Use `version_detector.py` to analyze CLAUDE.md:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_BASE_DIR/functions/version_detector.py" CLAUDE.md
```

This script checks for:
- Version markers (e.g., "Navigator Version: 3.1.0")
- Slash command references (`/nav:start`, `/nav:doc`, etc.)
- Skills vs commands language
- Natural language examples

**Outputs**:
- `outdated` - Has `/nav:` commands or v1/v2 markers
- `current` - Already v3.1 with natural language
- `unknown` - Can't determine (custom/non-Navigator file)

**If `current`**:
```
✅ CLAUDE.md is already up to date (v3.1)

No migration needed.
```
Exit successfully.

**If `unknown`**:
```
⚠️  CLAUDE.md doesn't appear to be a Navigator file

This might be a custom configuration. Manual review recommended.
Proceed with migration anyway? [y/N]
```

If user declines, exit. If accepts, continue.

### Step 2: Backup Current CLAUDE.md

Always create backup before modifying:

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.backup
echo "📦 Backup created: CLAUDE.md.backup"
```

### Step 3: Extract Project-Specific Customizations

Use `claude_updater.py` to parse current CLAUDE.md:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_BASE_DIR/functions/claude_updater.py" extract CLAUDE.md > /tmp/nav-customizations.json
```

This extracts:
- **Project name** (from title)
- **Project description** (from Context section)
- **Tech stack** (languages, frameworks)
- **Code standards** (custom rules beyond Navigator defaults)
- **Forbidden actions** (project-specific restrictions)
- **PM tool configuration** (Linear, GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- **Custom sections** (anything not in Navigator template)

### Step 4: Generate Updated CLAUDE.md

Apply v3.1 template with extracted customizations:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_BASE_DIR/functions/claude_updater.py" generate \
  --customizations /tmp/nav-customizations.json \
  --template "$SKILL_BASE_DIR/../../templates/CLAUDE.md" \
  --output CLAUDE.md
```

This:
1. Loads v3.1 template
2. Replaces placeholders with extracted data
3. Preserves custom sections
4. Updates Navigator workflow to natural language
5. Removes slash command references
6. Adds skills explanation

### Step 5: Show Diff and Confirm

Display changes for user review:

```bash
echo ""
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "📝 CHANGES TO CLAUDE.MD"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""

# Show unified diff
diff -u CLAUDE.md.backup CLAUDE.md || true

echo ""
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
```

### Step 6: Verify and Commit

Show summary of changes:

```
✅ CLAUDE.md Updated to v3.1

Key changes:
  ✓ Removed slash command references (e.g., /nav:start)
  ✓ Added natural language examples ("Start my Navigator session")
  ✓ Added skills architecture explanation
  ✓ Updated Navigator workflow section
  ✓ Preserved your project-specific customizations:
    - Tech stack: [list]
    - Code standards: [count] custom rules
    - Forbidden actions: [count] custom rules

Backup saved: CLAUDE.md.backup

Next steps:
  1. Review changes: git diff CLAUDE.md
  2. Test: "Start my Navigator session" should work
  3. Commit: git add CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: update CLAUDE.md to Navigator v3.1"
  4. Remove backup: rm CLAUDE.md.backup

Rollback if needed: mv CLAUDE.md.backup CLAUDE.md
```

### Step 7: Optional - Update .nav-config.json

If config exists, check version:

```bash
if [ -f ".agent/.nav-config.json" ]; then
  version=$(jq -r '.version' .agent/.nav-config.json)
  if [ "$version" != "3.1.0" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "💡 .nav-config.json is version $version"
    echo "   Update to 3.1.0? [Y/n]"
    read -r response

    if [[ "$response" =~ ^([yY][eE][sS]|[yY]|)$ ]]; then
      jq '.version = "3.1.0"' .agent/.nav-config.json > /tmp/nav-config.tmp
      mv /tmp/nav-config.tmp .agent/.nav-config.json
      echo "   ✓ Updated config to v3.1.0"
    fi
  fi
fi
```

## Predefined Functions

### functions/version_detector.py

**Purpose**: Detect CLAUDE.md version (outdated, current, unknown)

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 version_detector.py CLAUDE.md
```

**Output**: Prints one of: `outdated`, `current`, `unknown`

**Exit codes**:
- 0: Success (version detected)
- 1: File not found
- 2: Parse error

**Detection logic**:
1. Check for version marker: `Navigator Version: X.X.X`
2. Check for slash commands: `/nav:start`, `/jitd:`, etc.
3. Check for natural language examples: `"Start my Navigator session"`
4. Check for skills section

**Heuristics**:
- Has `/nav:` → outdated
- Version < 3.0 → outdated
- Version >= 3.0 + natural language → current
- No version + no Navigator markers → unknown

### functions/claude_updater.py

**Purpose**: Extract customizations and generate updated CLAUDE.md

**Usage**:
```bash
# Extract customizations
python3 claude_updater.py extract CLAUDE.md > customizations.json

# Generate updated file
python3 claude_updater.py generate \
  --customizations customizations.json \
  --template ../../templates/CLAUDE.md \
  --output CLAUDE.md
```

**Extract mode** outputs JSON:
```json
{
  "project_name": "MyApp",
  "description": "Brief project description",
  "tech_stack": ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "PostgreSQL"],
  "code_standards": ["Custom rule 1", "Custom rule 2"],
  "forbidden_actions": ["Custom restriction 1"],
  "pm_tool": "github",
  "custom_sections": {
    "Deployment": "Custom deployment instructions..."
  }
}
```

**Generate mode**:
1. Loads template
2. Replaces `[Project Name]` with `project_name`
3. Replaces `[Brief project description]` with `description`
4. Replaces `[List your technologies...]` with `tech_stack`
5. Appends custom code standards
6. Appends custom forbidden actions
7. Inserts custom sections at end

## Error Handling

**No CLAUDE.md found**:
```
❌ No CLAUDE.md found in current directory

This project doesn't appear to have Navigator initialized.
Run "Initialize Navigator in this project" first.
```

**Backup failed**:
```
❌ Failed to create backup: CLAUDE.md.backup

Check file permissions and disk space.
```

**Parse error**:
```
❌ Failed to parse CLAUDE.md

The file might be corrupted or have unusual formatting.
Manual review required.

Backup saved at: CLAUDE.md.backup
```

**Template not found**:
```
❌ Navigator template not found

This might be a plugin installation issue.
Try reinstalling Navigator plugin: /plugin update navigator
```

## Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:
- [ ] CLAUDE.md backed up successfully
- [ ] Version detected correctly
- [ ] Customizations extracted
- [ ] New file generated with v3.1 template
- [ ] Project-specific content preserved
- [ ] Diff shown to user for review
- [ ] Commit instructions provided

## Rollback Procedure

If migration fails or user is unhappy:

```bash
# Restore backup
mv CLAUDE.md.backup CLAUDE.md

# Or compare and manually fix
diff CLAUDE.md.backup CLAUDE.md
```

## Notes

This skill:
- **Preserves all customizations** (tech stack, standards, restrictions)
- **Non-destructive** (always creates backup)
- **Idempotent** (running multiple times is safe)
- **Transparent** (shows diff before finalizing)

**What gets updated**:
- Navigator version marker
- Slash commands → natural language
- Workflow examples
- Skills vs commands explanation
- Token optimization strategy

**What gets preserved**:
- Project name and description
- Tech stack
- Code standards
- Forbidden actions
- PM tool configuration
- Custom sections

## Related Skills

- **nav-init**: Initialize Navigator in new project (creates CLAUDE.md from scratch)
- **nav-start**: Start session (uses updated CLAUDE.md)
- **nav-task**: Task documentation (benefits from updated workflow)

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Update
