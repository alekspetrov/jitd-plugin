## Long-Form Variant (Threads Attachment)

Teach your Claude Code to design like a Product Designer.

Navigator v3.3.1 just landed with the complete design-to-production pipeline working end-to-end.

**What You Get:**

**Figma Integration (v3.2)**
â†’ Connect via Figma MCP
â†’ "Review this design from Figma"
â†’ Extracts design tokens (DTCG format)
â†’ Maps components to your codebase
â†’ Detects design system drift
â†’ Generates implementation plan
â†’ 6-10 hours â†’ 15 minutes (95% reduction)

**Visual Regression (v3.3)**
â†’ "Set up visual regression for Button"
â†’ Generates Storybook stories with ALL variants
â†’ Configures Chromatic/Percy/BackstopJS
â†’ Creates CI workflows (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
â†’ Adds accessibility tests
â†’ 2-3 hours â†’ 5 minutes (96% reduction)

**Automated Updates (v3.3.1)**

â†’ Detects current vs latest version
â†’ Executes update with retry logic
â†’ Updates your project CLAUDE.md
â†’ Shows new features
â†’ 12 minutes â†’ 2 minutes (83% reduction)

**The Complete Flow:**

1. Designer shares Figma link
2. You: "Review this design from Figma" (15 min)
3. You implement components (2-4 hours)
4. You: "Set up visual regression" (5 min)
5. Push PR â†’ Visual diffs show automatically
6. Designer approves in Chromatic
7. Ship to production

Total: ~2.5 hours for complete feature (was 12+ hours)

**18 skills total:**
â€¢ 11 core Navigator skills
