Navigator 3.4.0 released.

I've been working on design migrations from Figma and realised: we're wasting 15-20 orchestration steps just to extract design data.

So I fixed it.

Python now connects directly to Figma MCP:
✅ 95% orchestration reduction (20 steps → 1)
✅ 92% token savings (150k → 12k)
✅ 75% faster (15 min → 5 min)
✅ One-command setup: ./setup.sh

Just say: "Review this Figma design: [URL]"

What's your biggest design handoff pain point?

- Hook: Problem realization from real work
- Value: Clear metrics (95%, 92%, 75%)
- CTA: Two CTAs (try it + discuss)
- Engagement: Opening personal story + closing question
- Visual: Screenshot of "Review this Figma design" command + output

Navigator 3.4.0 🚀

Been doing Figma migrations. Realized we're wasting 15-20 steps just to extract designs.

Now: Python → Figma MCP directly
✅ 95% reduction (20 → 1 step)
✅ 92% tokens saved
✅ 75% faster

Before v3.4.0:
→ Claude calls MCP tool
→ Save to /tmp/metadata.json
→ Call another tool
→ Save to /tmp/variables.json
→ Run python script
→ 15-20 steps total
→ 150k tokens

After v3.4.0:
→ Python connects to MCP
→ 1 step
→ 12k tokens

95% reduction.

I've been working on design migrations from Figma to production code, and realised we're doing something fundamentally wrong.

**The Problem:**

Every time Claude Code extracts data from Figma, it requires 15-20 orchestration steps:
→ Call MCP tool manually
→ Save response to temp file
→ Call another tool
→ Save another file
→ Invoke Python script
→ Process all files
→ Return results

Each iteration costs 150k tokens on average. Design reviews take 15 minutes minimum. The overhead isn't technical debt—it's architectural.

**The Solution: Navigator v3.4.0**

We built a Python client that connects directly to Figma's MCP server. No Claude middleware. No manual orchestration. Just one autonomous call.

**What changed:**
• Python → Figma MCP (http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp)
• Official Anthropic MCP SDK (mcp>=1.2.1)
• Progressive refinement (fetches only needed data)
• Automatic connection management

**The impact:**
Orchestration: 15-20 steps → 1 step (95% reduction)
Token usage: 150k → 12k average (92% reduction)
Time: 15 minutes → 5 minutes (75% faster)

**How it works:**
1. User: "Review this Figma design: [URL]"
2. Python connects to Figma MCP automatically
3. Fetches metadata → analyzes → fetches details only if needed
4. Returns complete design review

**Setup:**
```bash
cd skills/product-design
./setup.sh  # 30 seconds
```

That's it. The script installs the MCP SDK and you're ready.

This is what AI-native design workflows should look like: autonomous, efficient, and invisible.

Navigator 3.4.0 released.

I've been working on design migrations from Figma and realized something painful:

Every time I asked Claude to extract design data, it needed 15-20 orchestration steps. Call this MCP tool. Save to /tmp. Call another tool. Save again. Run Python. Process files. Return results.

150,000 tokens on average.
15 minutes minimum.
Every. Single. Time.

This wasn't a bug. It was the architecture.

So we rebuilt it.

Python now connects directly to Figma MCP. No Claude middleware. No temp files. No manual orchestration.

Just: "Review this Figma design: [URL]"

The results:
→ 95% orchestration reduction (20 steps → 1)
→ 92% token savings (150k → 12k)
→ 75% faster (15 min → 5 min)

One command setup: ./setup.sh (30 seconds)

This is v3.4.0. Direct MCP integration using Anthropic's official Python SDK.
