Navigator 3.4.0 released.

I've been working on design migrations from Figma and realized:

LLMs are terrible at extracting layouts directly from Figma.

They can't parse 150k tokens of design XML into structured components. Too much noise. Too many false patterns.

But Python can.

So I built a Python ‚Üí Figma MCP bridge that does the hard work:
‚Üí Extracts metadata structure
‚Üí Parses component hierarchy
‚Üí Maps design tokens
‚Üí Returns clean JSON

Then the LLM gets structured data, not raw chaos.

Result:
‚úÖ 92% token reduction (150k ‚Üí 12k)
‚úÖ 95% fewer orchestration steps
‚úÖ Actually works reliably

Ever tried getting an LLM to parse complex structured data?

Hot take: LLMs are terrible at extracting layouts from Figma.

150k tokens of design XML? They can't parse it into clean components.

Solution: Python preprocesses the hard parts
‚Üí Structure extraction
‚Üí Component hierarchy
‚Üí Token mapping
‚Üí Clean JSON ‚Üí LLM

92% token reduction
95% fewer steps

**Tweet 2/4** (The Problem - 273/280):
```
The problem:

Figma MCP returns XML soup with:
- 26 nested elements
- Mixed component types
- Raw coordinate data
- Inline styles
- 150k+ tokens

LLMs pattern-match, they don't parse structures.

They hallucinate components. Miss relationships. Generate wrong hierarchies.
```

**Tweet 3/4** (The Solution - 259/280):
```
The fix:

Python does what it's good at:
‚Üí XML parsing (elementTree)
‚Üí Hierarchy traversal (recursion)
‚Üí Data normalization
‚Üí JSON serialization

Returns:
{
  "components": [...],
  "tokens": {...},
  "hierarchy": {...}
}

12k tokens of clean, structured data.
```

**Tweet 4/4** (The Result - 237/280):
```
Now the LLM gets:
‚úÖ Structured component list
‚úÖ Parsed design tokens
‚úÖ Clear hierarchy
‚úÖ 12k tokens instead of 150k

It can focus on what it's good at:
‚Üí Mapping to design system
‚Üí Generating implementation plan
‚Üí Writing code

I've been working on design migrations from Figma to production code, and realized something important about LLMs:

**They're terrible at extracting structured layouts from raw design data.**

**The Problem:**

Figma's MCP returns design XML with 150k+ tokens:
- 26 nested frame elements
- Mixed component types (instances, frames, groups)
- Raw coordinate systems
- Inline style properties
- Recursive child hierarchies

When you ask an LLM to "extract components from this," it tries to pattern-match its way through the noise. And it hallucinates:
‚Üí Invents components that don't exist
‚Üí Misses parent-child relationships
‚Üí Generates incorrect hierarchies
‚Üí Wastes tokens re-parsing the same data

**Why LLMs struggle with this:**

LLMs are probabilistic pattern matchers. They're brilliant at:
- Semantic understanding
- Natural language
- Code generation
- Contextual decisions

But they're not built for:
- Deterministic parsing
- Structure traversal
- Data normalization
- Schema validation

That's what traditional programming excels at.

**The Solution: Navigator v3.4.0**

We built a Python bridge that does the grunt work before the LLM sees the data:

1. **Python extracts structure** (what it's good at):
   - XML parsing with elementTree
   - Recursive hierarchy traversal
   - Component type normalization
   - Design token extraction
   - JSON serialization

2. **Returns clean, structured data**:
   ```json
   {
     "components": [{"name": "Button", "type": "atom", ...}],
     "tokens": {"primary-600": "#2563EB", ...},
     "hierarchy": {"dashboard": ["nav", "stats", ...]}
   }
   ```

3. **LLM receives 12k tokens** instead of 150k, and can focus on what it does best:
   - Mapping components to design system
   - Identifying reuse opportunities
   - Generating implementation plans
   - Writing production code

**The Results:**

Token usage: 150k ‚Üí 12k (92% reduction)
Orchestration: 15-20 steps ‚Üí 1 (95% reduction)
Reliability: Hallucinations ‚Üí Deterministic parsing
Time: 15 minutes ‚Üí 5 minutes

**The Principle:**

Use the right tool for the job:
- Python for deterministic data processing
- LLM for semantic understanding and code generation

This is Navigator v3.4.0. Direct Figma MCP integration with Python preprocessing.

One-command setup: `./setup.sh` (30 seconds)

Full release: https://github.com/alekspetrov/navigator/releases/tag/v3.4.0

**Thoughts?** What other tasks are we forcing LLMs to do that traditional code handles better?

üßµ Why Navigator v3.4.0 uses Python instead of letting the LLM parse Figma directly

Spoiler: LLMs are terrible at deterministic parsing

This is what I learned shipping direct Figma MCP integration:

A thread on using the right tool for the job üëá
```

**Tweet 2/5** (Problem - 268/280):
```
Figma's MCP returns 150k+ tokens of nested XML:

<frame id="1:303">
  <instance id="7:1290" name="Avatar">
    <frame id="8:123">
      ...26 levels deep

Ask an LLM to "extract components" and watch it:
‚Üí Hallucinate components
‚Üí Miss relationships
‚Üí Generate wrong hierarchies

Pattern matching ‚â† parsing
```

**Tweet 3/5** (Why - 266/280):
```
LLMs are probabilistic. They're brilliant at:
‚úÖ Semantic understanding
‚úÖ Natural language
‚úÖ Code generation
‚úÖ Contextual decisions

But not at:
‚ùå Deterministic parsing
‚ùå Structure traversal
‚ùå Schema validation
‚ùå Data normalization

You wouldn't use regex to parse HTML.
Don't use LLMs to parse XML.
```

**Tweet 4/5** (Solution - 251/280):
```
Navigator v3.4.0:

Python preprocesses (what it's good at):
‚Üí XML parsing
‚Üí Hierarchy traversal
‚Üí Token extraction
‚Üí JSON serialization

Returns 12k tokens of clean data.

Then the LLM does what IT's good at:
‚Üí Design system mapping
‚Üí Code generation
‚Üí Implementation planning
```

**Tweet 5/5** (Results - 223/280):

Results:

150k ‚Üí 12k tokens (92% reduction)
15-20 steps ‚Üí 1 step (95% reduction)

Right tool for the job.

## Technical Accuracy Notes

**Make sure posts clarify**:
- LLMs CAN understand Figma data semantically
- LLMs CANNOT parse it deterministically
- Python does structure extraction
- LLM does semantic understanding and code generation
- This is about playing to each tool's strengths

**Avoid claiming**:
- "LLMs are bad" (too broad)
- "LLMs can't do X" (they can, just inefficiently)
- "Always use Python" (wrong lesson)

**Right message**:
- "Use the right tool for the job"
- "LLMs for semantic, Python for deterministic"
- "Preprocessing enables better LLM results"
