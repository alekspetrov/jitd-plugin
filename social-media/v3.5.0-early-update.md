Working on Navigator update: turning it into a Context Engineering system.

Instructions + skills + scripts (.py), optimized to slash Claude token usage.

Early tests show big cuts with faster, cleaner context ✌️

More soon. Building in public.

Working on a big Navigator update.

Turning it from "a plugin" into a full Context Engineering system.

What that means:
→ Instructions teach context efficiency principles
→ Skills automate curation patterns
→ Python scripts preprocess before LLM
→ All optimized to slash Claude token usage

Early tests looking good. Big cuts in token waste, faster sessions, cleaner context.

Basically: teaching Claude how to work smarter, not harder.

More details coming. Building in public 🛠️

Early update on Navigator v3.5.0 development:

I'm transforming Navigator from a plugin into a Context Engineering framework.

**What's changing:**

Instead of just "reducing token usage," Navigator now teaches the principles behind efficient AI workflows:

• Instructions document context engineering patterns (from Anthropic's docs)
• Skills automate curation strategies (lazy loading, progressive refinement)
• Python scripts handle preprocessing (deterministic tasks before LLM)
• Everything optimized to eliminate token waste

**Early results:**

Testing shows significant improvements:
- Cleaner context windows
- Faster session performance
- Measurable token reductions
- More consistent AI behavior

**The insight:**

After reading Anthropic's context engineering documentation, I realized: we've been loading everything upfront. That's the problem.

Context engineering ≠ Prompt engineering
→ It's about curating what the AI sees, not just how you ask

Navigator v3.5.0 implements these patterns for your codebase.

Building in public. More details coming as I ship each phase.

Working on Navigator v3.5.0: Context Engineering system.

Not just "save tokens" anymore.
Teaching the *principles* behind efficient AI workflows.

Instructions + skills + Python scripts.
All optimized for Claude.

Early tests: 🔥

Thread 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/2** (Details):
```
What's context engineering?

From Anthropic's docs:
→ Curate what the AI sees (not everything)
→ Right tool for job (Python + LLM, not just LLM)
→ Progressive refinement (metadata first)

Navigator implements these patterns.

Early results show big cuts in token waste.

Building in public. Ship soon.

## Reddit Post (r/ClaudeAI)

**Title**: Working on Navigator v3.5.0: Context Engineering for Claude Code

**Body**:
```
Hey r/ClaudeAI,

Quick update on Navigator development:

I'm transforming it from "a plugin that saves tokens" into a full Context Engineering framework based on Anthropic's documentation.

**What that means:**

Instead of just features, Navigator now teaches the *principles* behind efficient AI workflows:

**1. Context engineering ≠ Prompt engineering**
- Prompt engineering: optimize the question
- Context engineering: curate what the AI sees
- Navigator implements curation patterns

**2. Implementation:**
- Instructions: Document principles (lazy loading, progressive refinement)
- Skills: Automate patterns (agent search, autonomous completion)
- Python scripts: Preprocess before LLM (deterministic → semantic)

**3. Early test results:**
- Cleaner context windows (less noise)
- Faster sessions (AI isn't overwhelmed)
- Measurable token cuts (verified, not estimated)
- More consistent behavior (signal > noise)

**The insight:**

After reading Anthropic's context engineering docs, I realized we've been doing it wrong:
- Loading everything upfront? That's bulk loading
- Context engineering is *strategic curation*

Navigator v3.5.0 implements this for your codebase.

**Status:**
- Philosophy docs: ✅ Done
- README rewrite: ✅ Done
- Metrics system: 🚧 In progress
- Full release: ~8 weeks

Building in public. AMA about context engineering or Navigator!

## Quick Update (Casual)

**For Discord/Slack communities:**

```
Quick update: working on Navigator v3.5.0

Turning it into a full Context Engineering system (not just "save tokens")

Based on Anthropic's context engineering docs:
- Curate what AI sees (not bulk load)
- Python for deterministic, LLM for semantic
- Progressive refinement patterns

Early tests looking really good. Big cuts in token waste, cleaner context.

Philosophy docs done, README rewritten, building metrics system now.

~8 weeks to full release. Building in public 🚀
