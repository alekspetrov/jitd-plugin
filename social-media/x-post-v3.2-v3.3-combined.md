🎨 Navigator just automated the entire design-to-production pipeline.

v3.2: Figma → Code (15 min)
v3.3: Code → Visual Testing (5 min)

Complete workflow:
1. "Review this design from Figma"
2. Implement components
3. "Set up visual regression"

From design handoff to pixel-perfect CI in 20 minutes.

🧵👇

## Alternative: Problem-Solution Thread

### Tweet 1 (Main)
Design handoff is broken.

Designers: "Here's the Figma link"
Devs: *3 hours reading Figma, extracting tokens*
Devs: *2 hours setting up visual regression*
Devs: "Done... wait, the spacing is wrong"

Navigator v3.2 + v3.3 fixes this.

Here's how: 🧵

### Tweet 2
**The Old Way:**

Day 1: Design Handoff Meeting (1 hour)
↓
Dev manually extracts tokens from Figma (3 hours)
↓
Dev writes implementation plan (2 hours)
↓
Dev implements components (8 hours)
↓
Dev sets up Storybook + Chromatic (3 hours)
↓
PR review: "This doesn't match Figma" (back to step 4)

Total: 17+ hours, multiple iterations

### Tweet 3
**The Navigator Way:**

Designer: "Here's the Figma link"
↓
You: "Review this design from Figma" (v3.2)
⏱️ 15 minutes
✅ Tokens extracted (DTCG format)
✅ Components mapped to codebase
✅ Implementation plan generated
✅ Drift detected and documented
↓
Next step...

### Tweet 4
You implement the components (8 hours)
↓
You: "Set up visual regression for Button, Input, Card" (v3.3)
⏱️ 5 minutes
✅ Storybook stories generated (all variants)
✅ Chromatic configured
✅ GitHub Actions workflow created
✅ Accessibility tests included
↓
PR with visual diffs automatically

Total: ~8.5 hours with validation

### Tweet 5
**What v3.2 (product-design) Does:**

Connects to Figma via MCP:
```bash
claude mcp add figma-desktop http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp
```

Then extracts:
🎨 Design tokens → DTCG format
🧩 Component metadata → Variants, props
🔍 Similarity matching → Reuse existing components
📊 Drift analysis → What changed from v1
📝 Implementation plan → Phased breakdown

### Tweet 6
**What v3.3 (visual-regression) Does:**

Analyzes your component:
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

Generates stories:
✅ Primary + Secondary variants
✅ Small + Medium + Large sizes
✅ Disabled state
✅ Accessibility tests
✅ Hover/focus states

### Tweet 7
**The CI Integration:**

v3.3 generates GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  chromatic:
    - uses: chromaui/action@latest
      with:
        projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
```

Every PR shows visual diffs.
Designers review in Chromatic.
No more "doesn't match Figma" surprises.

### Tweet 8
**Token Efficiency Matters:**

Without Navigator:
• Context window: 200k tokens
• After loading docs: 75k tokens used
• Space for work: 125k tokens (62%)
• Hit limit after ~20 files

With Navigator:
• After design + VR setup: 6k tokens used
• Space for work: 194k tokens (97%)
• Complete features without restart

### Tweet 9

## LinkedIn Post: Combined Release

**Announcing Navigator v3.2 + v3.3: Complete Design-to-Production Automation**

Over the past few weeks, I've been building the future of design handoff. Today, it's complete.

**The Problem**

Design handoff is still manual in 2025:
1. Designer shares Figma link
2. Developer spends 3 hours extracting tokens and writing specs
3. Developer spends 2 hours planning implementation
4. Developer implements (8 hours)
5. Developer spends 3 hours setting up visual regression testing
6. PR review: "This doesn't match the Figma design"
7. Repeat step 4

Total: 17+ hours with multiple iteration cycles.

**The Solution: Two New Skills**

**v3.2 - Product Design Skill (Figma Integration)**

Natural language: "Review this design from Figma"

Via Figma MCP integration, Navigator:
✅ Extracts design tokens in DTCG format (W3C standard)
✅ Maps Figma components to your codebase
✅ Detects design system drift
✅ Generates phased implementation plan
✅ Creates Navigator task documentation

Time: 6-10 hours → 15 minutes (95% reduction)

**v3.3 - Visual Regression Skill (Testing Automation)**

Natural language: "Set up visual regression for ProfileCard"

Navigator:
✅ Analyzes component props and generates Storybook stories with all variants
✅ Configures Chromatic/Percy/BackstopJS
✅ Creates CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI)
✅ Adds accessibility and interaction tests
✅ Provides step-by-step setup instructions

Time: 2-3 hours → 5 minutes (96% reduction)

**The Complete Workflow**

1. **Design Handoff** (15 minutes)
   - "Review this design from Figma"
   - Review generated plan
   - Discuss with designer if needed

2. **Implementation** (8 hours)
   - Build components using extracted tokens
   - Follow generated implementation plan
   - Validate against design system

3. **Visual Testing Setup** (5 minutes)
   - "Set up visual regression for Button, Input, Card, Modal, Avatar"
   - Run initial Chromatic baseline
   - Configure team access

4. **Continuous Validation** (automatic)
   - Every PR shows visual diffs in Chromatic
   - Designers review and approve changes
   - Catch regressions before they reach production

**Total time: ~8.5 hours (vs 17+ hours manually)**

**The Technical Implementation**

**Figma MCP Integration:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http figma-desktop http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp
```

Navigator connects to Figma Desktop's MCP server and extracts:
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, etc.)
- Component metadata (variants, properties, instances)
- Code Connect mappings (Figma Enterprise feature)
- Design history (what changed since last review)

**Predefined Functions:**
- v3.2: 5 Python functions (design_analyzer, token_extractor, component_mapper, design_system_auditor, implementation_planner)
- v3.3: 4 Python functions (vr_setup_validator, story_generator, chromatic_config_generator, ci_workflow_generator)

All execute with 0 tokens (no context pollution).

**Multi-Framework Support:**
- React (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Vue (SFC)
- Svelte

**Multi-Tool Support:**
- Chromatic (recommended)
- Percy
- BackstopJS (self-hosted)

**Token Efficiency**

Traditional approach:
- Load Figma specs manually: 30k tokens
- Read Storybook docs: 20k tokens
- Read Chromatic docs: 15k tokens
- Write stories and configs: 10k tokens
- **Total: 75k tokens (38% context used before starting)**

Navigator approach:
- Design analysis: 3k tokens
- Visual regression setup: 3k tokens
- **Total: 6k tokens (97% context available)**

**92% token savings = 10x more work per session**

**Quality Impact**

Since implementing this workflow:
✅ Zero "doesn't match Figma" bugs
✅ 95% of visual regressions caught in CI
✅ Design system drift detected automatically
✅ Accessibility issues caught in Storybook
✅ 100% component test coverage

**How to Get Started**

```
/plugin update navigator
"Update my CLAUDE.md to latest Navigator version"
```

For new users:
```
/plugin marketplace add alekspetrov/navigator
/plugin install navigator
