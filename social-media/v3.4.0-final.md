I've been working on design migrations from Figma to production code, and realized something important about LLMs:

They're terrible at extracting structured layouts from Figma's data.

Here is the Problem:

Figma's MCP returns design XML with 150k+ tokens (in my case):
- 26 nested frame elements
- Mixed component types (instances, frames, groups)
- Raw coordinate systems
- Inline style properties
- Recursive child hierarchies

When you ask an LLM to "extract components from this," it tries to pattern-match its way through the noise. And hallucinates a lot.

The Solution I used for Navigator v3.4.0

We've built a Python bridge that does the grunt work before the LLM sees the data:

1. Python extracts structure (what it's good at):
   - XML parsing with elementTree
   - Recursive hierarchy traversal
   - Component type normalization
   - Design token extraction
   - JSON serialization

2. Returns clean, structured data:
  ```json
  {
   "components": [{"name": "Button", "type": "atom", ...}],
   "tokens": {"primary-600": "#2563EB", ...},
   "hierarchy": {"dashboard": ["nav", "stats", ...]}
  }
  ```

3. LLM receives only 12k tokens, and focus on what it does best:
  - Mapping components to design system
  - Identifying reuse opportunities
  - Generating implementation plans
  - Writing production code

The Results after tests:

Token usage: 150k → 12k (92% reduction)
Orchestration: 15-20 steps → 1 (95% reduction)
Reliability: Hallucinations → Deterministic parsing
Time: 15 minutes → 5 minutes 🎉

The Principle

Use the right tool for the job:
- Python for deterministic data processing
- LLM for semantic understanding and code generation

This is Navigator v3.4.0. Direct Figma MCP integration with Python preprocessing.

Figma's MCP returns 150k+ tokens of nested XML. When you ask an LLM to "extract components," it pattern-matches through noise and hallucinates.

The Solution (Navigator v3.4.0):
Python bridge that preprocesses before the LLM sees data:
→ XML parsing
→ Hierarchy traversal
→ Token extraction
→ Returns clean JSON

LLM receives 12k tokens and does what it's best at:
→ Design system mapping
→ Implementation planning
→ Code generation

Results:
✅ 92% token reduction (150k → 12k)
✅ 95% fewer steps (20 → 1)
✅ No hallucinations
✅ 5 min vs 15 min 🎉

Use the right tool for the job:
Python for parsing, LLM for understanding.

```
I've been working on Figma → production migrations and realized:

LLMs are terrible at extracting structured layouts from Figma.

Figma MCP returns 150k tokens of nested XML. Ask LLM to parse it? Hallucinations.

So I built Navigator v3.4.0 with Python preprocessing 🧵

github.com/alekspetrov/navigator
```

### Tweet 2/5 (Problem - 279/280)

```
The Problem:

Figma MCP returns 150k+ tokens:
- 26 nested frame elements
- Mixed component types
- Raw coordinates
- Inline styles
- Recursive hierarchies

LLM tries to pattern-match through the noise.

Result? It invents components, misses relationships, generates wrong hierarchies.
```

### Tweet 3/5 (Solution - 267/280)

```
The Solution (Navigator v3.4.0):

Python bridge preprocesses:
→ XML parsing (elementTree)
→ Hierarchy traversal
→ Component normalization
→ Token extraction
→ JSON serialization

Returns clean, structured data.

12k tokens instead of 150k.

LLM gets what it needs, not what it can't handle.
```

### Tweet 4/5 (Results - 241/280)

```
The Results:

Token usage: 150k → 12k (92% ↓)
Orchestration: 20 steps → 1 (95% ↓)
Reliability: Hallucinations → Deterministic
Time: 15 min → 5 min 🎉

LLM now focuses on:
→ Design system mapping
→ Implementation planning
→ Code generation

Right tool for the job.
```

### Tweet 5/5 (CTA - 209/280)

```
The Principle:

Python for deterministic data processing
LLM for semantic understanding and code generation

One-command setup: ./setup.sh (30 seconds)

Try it: /plugin marketplace add alekspetrov/navigator

Navigator v3.4.0 🚀

LLMs hallucinate when parsing Figma's 150k token XML.

Solution: Python preprocesses structure → returns 12k JSON → LLM does semantic work

Results:
✅ 92% token reduction
✅ 95% fewer steps
✅ 5 min vs 15 min

Right tool for the job.

## Visual Assets Recommendation

### 1. Before/After Diagram
```
❌ BEFORE
Figma MCP (150k tokens XML) → LLM → Hallucinations → Retry → Maybe works

✅ AFTER
Figma MCP → Python Parser → Clean JSON (12k) → LLM → Reliable output
```

### 2. Problem Illustration
Show sample of Figma XML:
```xml
<frame id="1:303" name="/dashboard" x="2671" y="-362">
  <instance id="7:1290" name="Avatar" x="32" y="24">
    <frame id="8:123">
      <!-- 26 levels deep... -->
```

vs Structured JSON:
```json
{
  "name": "Avatar",
  "type": "atom",
  "size": "40x40"
}
```

### 3. Metrics Chart
```
Token Usage:  150k ━━━━━━━━━━ → 12k ━  (92% ↓)
Steps:        20 ━━━━━━━━━━━━ → 1 ━   (95% ↓)
Time:         15m ━━━━━━━━━━ → 5m ━━━ (67% ↓)
```

- Threads: Adapted version (498 chars)

**Rationale**: Post on LinkedIn first for professional audience, Threads for broader reach

### Day 2 (Wednesday)
**9:00 AM ET**:
- X: Full 5-tweet thread

**Rationale**: Let LinkedIn simmer for a day, then hit X with thread for tech audience

### Day 3-7 (Ongoing)
- Monitor comments and engage

- Post visual assets (diagrams, metrics)
- RT/share community feedback

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Expected Questions

**Q: "Why not just use Figma's REST API?"**
A: "REST API requires auth tokens, file IDs, manual pagination. MCP with preprocessing gives direct access through Figma Desktop with zero config. Plus progressive refinement - fetch only what you need."

**Q: "Does this work without Figma Enterprise?"**
A: "Yes! Code Connect (Enterprise) is optional for automatic component mapping. Without it, we use fuzzy name matching. Works great either way."

**Q: "What about Figma web vs Desktop?"**
A: "Requires Figma Desktop with MCP enabled. Desktop exposes local MCP server at :3845. Web doesn't have this (yet). Takes 10 seconds to enable in preferences."

**Q: "Can I see the Python code?"**
A: "Absolutely! `skills/product-design/functions/figma_mcp_client.py` - 309 lines, fully documented. Uses official Anthropic MCP SDK (`pip install mcp`)"

### Discussion Threads to Start

**Tech Philosophy**:
- "What other tasks are we forcing LLMs to do that Python handles better?"
- "Where's the line between 'preprocess with code' vs 'let LLM figure it out'?"

**Similar Problems**:
- "CSV parsing - same issue. Use pandas first, LLM for analysis"
- "Log files - grep/awk for structure, LLM for insights"
- "API responses - jq for transformation, LLM for logic"

**Architecture Patterns**:
- "Emerging pattern: Traditional code for deterministic, LLM for semantic"
- "This is how we'll build all AI tools - preprocessing layers matter"

## Key Messages to Maintain

### What to emphasize:
✅ LLMs aren't universal solutions
✅ Preprocessing enables better LLM results
✅ Right tool for the job (Python AND LLM, not versus)
✅ Real metrics from real usage (150k → 12k in actual testing)
✅ Principle generalizes beyond Figma (parsing, structure, determinism)

### What to avoid:
❌ "LLMs are bad" (too broad, wrong message)
❌ "Always use Python" (misses the point)
❌ "Figma is hard" (it's not Figma's fault)
❌ Claiming LLMs "can't" do X (they can, just inefficiently)

### Core narrative:
"I tried the obvious thing (LLM parses Figma directly). It failed. I realized why (wrong tool). I fixed it (Python preprocesses, LLM understands). Now it works (92% better)."
